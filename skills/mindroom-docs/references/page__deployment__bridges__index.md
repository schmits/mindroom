# Bridges

MindRoom uses [mautrix](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/) bridges to connect external messaging platforms to Matrix.
Bridges run as appservices alongside a Matrix homeserver such as Synapse or Tuwunel, create ghost users for external contacts, and relay messages bidirectionally.

## Available Bridges

| Bridge | Platform | Mode | Status |

## How Bridges Work

Each bridge registers as a Matrix [Application Service](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/application-service-api/) with the homeserver.
The bridge:

1. Creates ghost users on Matrix for external contacts
2. Creates Matrix rooms for external chats
3. Relays messages between the external platform and Matrix in real time

In **puppet mode**, you log into your real account on the external platform. Your messages appear as coming from you on both sides, not from a bot.

## Bridge Manager

Bridge deployments are managed from `local/instances/deploy/`.
Run `./bridge.py --help` there for the exact supported commands.

The normal workflow is:

1. Add the bridge with `./bridge.py add <type> --instance <name>`.
2. Generate its appservice registration with `./bridge.py register <type> --instance <name>`.
3. For Synapse, manually expose the generated registration file to the Synapse container, set the matching `app_service_config_files` path, and restart Synapse; for Tuwunel, complete the printed admin-room steps or run `./bridge.py register-with-matrix <type> --instance <name>`.
4. Start it with `./bridge.py start <type> --instance <name>`.
5. Inspect it with `./bridge.py status` and `./bridge.py logs <type> --instance <name>`.

Generated bridge data lives beneath the selected instance data directory.
The manager currently updates Synapse's `homeserver.yaml`, but the local Compose layout does not mount the generated bridge registration into the Synapse container, so the file path still requires manual wiring.
Tuwunel registration requires the separate admin-room flow.

Adding a new bridge type requires a template under `local/instances/deploy/templates/bridges/` plus corresponding manager support.
