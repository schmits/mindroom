# Attachments

MindRoom can process files, images, audio, and videos sent to Matrix rooms, passing them to agents and teams for analysis or action.
Supported attachment kinds: `audio`, `file`, `image`, `video`.

## Overview

When a user sends a file, image, audio message, or video in a Matrix room:

1. The responder determines whether it should answer (via mention, thread participation, or DM)
2. The media is downloaded and decrypted (if E2E encrypted)
3. The file is saved locally and registered as a context-scoped attachment
4. The responder receives the media as an Agno `File`, `Video`, `Audio`, or `Image` object plus an attachment ID it can reference in tool calls
5. The responder replies with its analysis or takes action on the file

Attachment support works automatically for agents and teams -- no configuration is needed.

## How It Works

                                                            ┌─────────────┐

                                                            │ Replies     │
                                                            └─────────────┘
```

## Usage

Send a file, image, audio message, or video in a Matrix room and mention the agent or team in the caption:

- **With caption**: `@assistant Summarize this document` -- the caption is used as the prompt
- **Without caption**: The agent receives `[Attached file]`, `[Attached image]`, `[Attached audio]`, or `[Attached video]` as the prompt
- **Bare filename**: If the body is just the filename (e.g., `report.pdf`), it is treated the same as no caption

Attachments work in both direct messages and threads, and with both individual agents and teams.

## Attachment IDs

Each uploaded file or video is assigned a stable attachment ID (e.g., `att_abc123`).
Attachments sent with the current message are listed in the prompt with full provenance (kind, filename, sender, send time, and originating event ID):

```
Attachments sent with the current message (use tool calls to inspect or process them by ID):
- att_abc123 (image, "car.jpg", from @user:example.org, sent 2026-06-06 09:00 UTC, event $abc)
```

Earlier attachments stay attached to the conversation messages that carried them: when thread history is rendered for the model, each message gets an inline annotation and (for user messages) the media itself, so attachments appear in chronological position:

```
@user:example.org: check this out
[attachments: att_def456 (image, "house.jpg")]
```

Keeping media bytes pinned to their original messages also keeps the request prefix stable across turns, so provider prompt caching covers previously sent media instead of re-processing it every turn.

Attachment IDs are **context-scoped** -- an attachment registered in one room or thread is not accessible from another.
This prevents cross-room data leakage for ID-based access.
Voice raw-audio fallback uses the same attachment ID mechanism; see [Voice Fallback](https://docs.mindroom.chat/voice/#voice-fallback-no-stt-available).

## The `attachments` Tool

Agents can use the optional `attachments` tool to interact with context-scoped attachments programmatically.

### Enabling

Add `attachments` to the agent's tool list:

```yaml
agents:
  assistant:
    tools:
      - attachments
```

### Operations

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `list_attachments(target?)` | List metadata for attachments in the current context (ID, kind, local_path, filename, MIME type, size, room_id, thread_id, sender, event_timestamp, created_at) |
| `get_attachment(attachment_id, mindroom_output_path?)` | Return one context attachment record, or save its bytes to a workspace-relative path and return a save receipt |
| `register_attachment(file_path)` | Register a local file path as a context attachment ID (`att_*`) |

When `mindroom_output_path` is omitted, `get_attachment()` returns the attachment metadata response, including the runtime-local `local_path`.
For worker-routed agents, prefer `get_attachment("att_...", mindroom_output_path="incoming/file.ext")` before processing an attachment with `file`, `coding`, `python`, or `shell`, because the runtime-local path may not exist inside the worker workspace.
`mindroom_output_path` must be a file path relative to the agent workspace.
It must not be empty, absolute, point at the workspace root, contain `..` or NUL bytes, or use environment or user expansion.
When the save succeeds, the response includes `mindroom_tool_output` with `status: "saved_to_file"`, `path`, byte count, `format: "binary"`, and `sha256`.
In worker-routed shell and python tools, that workspace is also exposed as `~`, `$HOME`, and `$MINDROOM_AGENT_WORKSPACE`, so `incoming/file.ext` and `~/incoming/file.ext` refer to the same saved file.

`attachment_ids` accepts only context attachment IDs (`att_*`).
`attachment_file_paths` accepts local file paths and auto-registers them in the current context before sending.
Relative paths resolve from the agent workspace when one is available.
Relative paths must stay inside the workspace.
Use `matrix_message(action="send"|"reply"|"thread-reply", attachment_ids=..., attachment_file_paths=...)` to send attachments.

### Why use this tool?

Not all AI models support direct file inputs.
The `attachments` tool lets any model work with files by calling tools that operate on attachment IDs, even if the model itself cannot ingest the raw bytes.

## Encryption

Both unencrypted and E2E encrypted files and videos are supported.
Encrypted media is decrypted transparently using the key material from the Matrix event.

## Caching

AI response caching is automatically skipped when files, images, audio, or videos are present, since media payloads are large and unlikely to repeat.

## Retention

MindRoom automatically prunes attachment metadata and managed `incoming_media/` files older than 30 days.
Pruning runs opportunistically during new attachment registration.

## Limitations

- **Routing with multiple eligible responders** -- without an `@mention`, the router uses the file caption to select among candidates only when room configuration and reply permissions leave multiple eligible agents or teams.
- **Model support** -- the configured model must support file or video inputs for direct analysis. Models that do not can still use the `attachments` tool to inspect and process files via tool calls.
