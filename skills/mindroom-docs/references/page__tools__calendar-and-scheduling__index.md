# Calendar & Scheduling

Use these tools to read external calendars, manage bookings, and schedule future agent work inside MindRoom.

## What This Page Covers

This page documents the built-in tools in the `calendar-and-scheduling` group.
Use these tools when you need Google Calendar access, Cal.com booking APIs, or Matrix-native scheduled tasks that post back into MindRoom later.

## Tools On This Page

- [`google_calendar`] - Read Google Calendar data and, when enabled, create, update, or delete events through Google OAuth.
- [`cal_com`] - Query Cal.com availability and manage bookings through the Cal.com API.
- [`scheduler`] - Schedule, edit, list, and cancel MindRoom tasks and reminders in the current Matrix conversation.

## Common Setup Notes

`google_calendar` is a per-service Google OAuth integration.
It uses the `google_calendar` OAuth provider instead of an API key form.
It supports shared and requester-isolated worker scopes, with OAuth credentials resolved for the active execution identity.
Use [Google Services OAuth (Admin Setup)](https://docs.mindroom.chat/deployment/google-services-oauth/) or [Google Services OAuth (Individual Setup)](https://docs.mindroom.chat/deployment/google-services-user-oauth/) to connect Google before enabling `google_calendar`.
`cal_com` is a standard credential-backed tool with its own config fields and no shared-only restriction.
`scheduler` is MindRoom's built-in scheduling system, so it does not need dashboard OAuth setup or API keys.
Unlike the two calendar API tools, `scheduler` depends on the active Matrix `ToolRuntimeContext`, so it only works from a live room or thread.
MindRoom also includes `scheduler` in `defaults.tools` by default on this branch.

## [`google_calendar`]

`google_calendar` wraps Agno's Google Calendar toolkit with MindRoom-scoped Google OAuth credentials.

### What It Does

`google_calendar` exposes `list_events()`, `get_event()`, `fetch_all_events()`, `find_available_slots()`, `list_calendars()`, `check_availability()`, `get_event_attendees()`, `search_events()`, `create_event()`, `update_event()`, `delete_event()`, `quick_add_event()`, `move_event()`, and `respond_to_event()`.
MindRoom loads the connected Google account from its unified credential store instead of relying on a per-process `token.json`.
The OAuth provider requests narrowly targeted scopes for event access, calendar listing, availability, and working-hours settings, while MindRoom gates write methods with the `allow_update` setting.
Write calls are enabled by default and can be removed from the tool surface with `allow_update: false`.
When no usable MindRoom OAuth credentials exist, the wrapper raises `OAuthConnectionRequired` instead of falling back to Agno's local token flow.
`find_available_slots()` derives openings from the user's current calendar events plus working-hours settings inferred from Google Calendar settings and locale.

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `calendar_id` | `text` | `no` | `primary` | Google Calendar ID to query or update. |
| `allow_update` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Expose create, update, delete, quick-add, move, and invitation-response operations. |

### Example

```yaml
agents:
  assistant:
    tools:
      - google_calendar:
          calendar_id: primary
          allow_update: true
```

```python
list_events(limit=5)
find_available_slots(start_date="2026-04-01", end_date="2026-04-03", duration_minutes=30)
create_event(
    start_date="2026-04-02T15:00:00",
    end_date="2026-04-02T15:30:00",
    title="Deployment review",
    attendees=["ops@example.com"],
    add_google_meet_link=True,
)
```

### Notes

- `calendar_id` defaults to `primary`, and `list_calendars()` can return the other calendar IDs available to the connected account.
- If the Google Calendar connection is missing any required Calendar scope, `google_calendar` stays unavailable until the user reconnects and grants it.
- Use the Google Services OAuth guides for consent-screen setup, redirect URIs, and environment variables.

## [`cal_com`]

`cal_com` talks to the Cal.com v2 booking API for availability lookup and booking management.

### What It Does

`cal_com` exposes `get_available_slots()`, `create_booking()`, `get_upcoming_bookings()`, `reschedule_booking()`, and `cancel_booking()`.
The toolkit uses one configured `event_type_id` as the default booking type for slot lookup and booking creation.
Responses are converted from UTC into `user_timezone` before they are returned.
The per-method enable flags let you narrow the exposed call surface when an agent should only inspect availability or only manage existing bookings.

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `api_key` | `password` | `no` | `null` | Cal.com API key. Configure this through the dashboard or credential store rather than inline YAML. |
| `event_type_id` | `number` | `no` | `null` | Default Cal.com event type ID used for slot lookup and new bookings. |
| `user_timezone` | `text` | `no` | `null` | IANA timezone used when formatting returned booking times. |
| `enable_get_available_slots` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `get_available_slots()`. |
| `enable_create_booking` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `create_booking()`. |
| `enable_get_upcoming_bookings` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `get_upcoming_bookings()`. |
| `enable_reschedule_booking` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `reschedule_booking()`. |
| `enable_cancel_booking` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `cancel_booking()`. |
| `all` | `boolean` | `no` | `false` | Enable every Cal.com operation at once. |

### Example

```yaml
agents:
  scheduler_assistant:
    tools:
      - cal_com:
          event_type_id: 123456
          user_timezone: America/Los_Angeles
          enable_cancel_booking: false
```

```python
get_available_slots(start_date="2026-04-01", end_date="2026-04-07")
create_booking(
    start_time="2026-04-03T17:00:00+00:00",
    name="Alex Example",
    email="alex@example.com",
)
get_upcoming_bookings(email="alex@example.com")
```

### Notes

- Although the metadata marks `api_key` and `event_type_id` as optional fields, the runtime only works properly when those values are supplied either through stored credentials or the `CALCOM_API_KEY` and `CALCOM_EVENT_TYPE_ID` environment variables.
- If `user_timezone` is omitted, the upstream toolkit falls back to `America/New_York`.
- `api_key` is a password field, so MindRoom blocks inline YAML overrides for it in normal authored config.
- All current requests go to `https://api.cal.com/v2`.

## [`scheduler`]

`scheduler` is MindRoom's built-in task scheduler for future messages, reminders, and recurring agent or team work.

### What It Does

`scheduler` exposes `schedule()`, `edit_schedule()`, `list_schedules()`, and `cancel_schedule()`.
It reuses the same backend as `!schedule`, `!edit_schedule`, `!list_schedules`, and `!cancel_schedule`.
Pass `new_thread=False` to post back into the current room or thread scope, or `new_thread=True` to schedule a future room-level root message.
The optional `history_limit` argument caps how many recent messages the scheduled responder sees each time the task fires.
Use `history_limit=0` for no prior conversation context, or a positive integer to keep that many recent messages.
Pass `silent=True` to hide the scheduled trigger and omit successful final responses that are empty or contain only `NO_REPLY`.
Findings, failures, and messages explicitly sent by tools remain visible for silent schedules.
Scheduled tasks are stored in Matrix room state and persist across restarts.
The scheduler validates mentioned agents and teams against the current room or thread before it saves a task.
If no Matrix room context is available, the tool returns an unavailable error instead of creating a task.

### Configuration

This tool has no tool-specific inline configuration fields.

### Example

```yaml
agents:
  assistant:
    tools:
      - scheduler
```

```python
schedule("tomorrow at 9am @ops check the deployment", new_thread=False)
schedule("every weekday at 8am post the on-call handoff summary", new_thread=True)
schedule("every hour @ops check deployment health", new_thread=False, history_limit=0)
schedule("every 5 minutes check the inbox for urgent mail", new_thread=False, history_limit=0, silent=True)
list_schedules()
edit_schedule("a1b2c3d4", "tomorrow at 10am @ops check the deployment", history_limit=5, silent=False)
cancel_schedule("a1b2c3d4")
```

### Notes

- `scheduler` needs no dashboard setup and is included in `defaults.tools` by default unless you explicitly disable that inheritance.
- Editing preserves the original schedule type, so switching between one-time and recurring schedules requires cancelling the old task and creating a new one.
- Editing preserves an existing history limit unless the edit request or explicit tool argument changes it.
- Editing preserves the current silent-delivery mode unless the natural-language request or `silent` argument changes it.
- Use natural-language edit phrases such as `restore full history` to remove a history limit through chat, or pass `history_limit` through the tool when the agent should set a concrete cap.
- A silent schedule with `new_thread=True` posts any finding or failure as a room-level root because its hidden trigger cannot serve as a visible thread root.
- Silent delivery controls room presentation only; the task body still travels through Matrix and remains subject to homeserver retention and MindRoom's durable recovery journal.
- Conditional phrases such as `if` and `when` are converted into recurring polling schedules rather than real event subscriptions.
- Use [Scheduling](https://docs.mindroom.chat/scheduling/) for the full command syntax, timezone behavior, persistence details, and command-line aliases.
