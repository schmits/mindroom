# Chat Commands

MindRoom provides chat commands that users can type in any Matrix room where MindRoom agents or teams are present.
Commands start with `!` and are handled by the router agent.

## Quick Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!help [topic]` | Get help on commands or a specific topic |
| `!hi` | Show the welcome message again |
| `!schedule <task>` | Schedule a task or reminder |
| `!list_schedules` | List pending scheduled tasks |
| `!cancel_schedule <id>` | Cancel a scheduled task |
| `!edit_schedule <id> <task>` | Edit an existing scheduled task |
| `!model [name\|list\|reset]` | Show or switch the model used in the current thread |
| `!thread_mode [room\|thread\|reset\|show]` | Show or switch the thread mode used in the current room |
| `!config <operation>` | View and modify configuration (disabled by default, admin only when enabled) |
| `!reload-plugins` | Force-reload all configured plugins (admin only) |

## Who Handles Commands

The **router** handles all commands exclusively.
Even in single-responder rooms, commands are always processed by the router, not the responder.
Commands work in both main room messages and within threads.

Voice messages that contain commands (e.g., spoken `!schedule`) are recognized after transcription and processed the same way.

## Permission Behavior

Commands are subject to the same authorization rules as normal messages.
The sender must be authorized to interact with MindRoom entities in the room (via `global_users`, `room_permissions`, or `default_room_access`).
See [Authorization](https://docs.mindroom.chat/authorization/) for details.

`!config` is disabled by default.
Set `authorization.config_command_enabled: true` to enable it.
When enabled, callers must be in `authorization.global_users`.
For `!config set`, only the user who requested the change can confirm or cancel it via reactions.
Pending config changes expire after 24 hours.

## Commands

### `!help`

Display available commands or get detailed help on a specific topic.

```
!help
!help schedule
!help config
!help cancel_schedule
!help edit_schedule
```

**Topics:** `schedule`, `config`, `model`, `thread_mode`, `thread-mode`, `threadmode`, `list_schedules`, `inspect_schedules`, `cancel`, `cancel_schedule`, `edit`, `edit_schedule`

### `!hi`

Show the welcome message for the current room, listing available agents and teams, their roles and tools, and quick-start instructions.

```
!hi
```

### `!schedule`

Schedule a one-time or recurring task using natural language.

Tasks run in the thread where they were created.

```
!schedule <natural-language-request>
```

**One-time tasks:**

```
!schedule in 5 minutes Check the deployment
!schedule tomorrow at 3pm Send the weekly report
```

**Recurring tasks:**

```
!schedule Every hour, @shell check server status
!schedule Daily at 9am, @finance market report
!schedule Weekly on Friday, @analyst prepare weekly summary
```

**Conditional workflows (polling-based):**

Conditional requests are converted to recurring cron-based polling schedules.

These are periodic checks, not real event subscriptions.

```
!schedule If I get an email about "urgent", @phone_agent call me
!schedule When Bitcoin drops below $40k, @crypto_agent notify me
```

Include `@agent_name` or `@team_name` in your schedule to target specific responders.

The scheduler validates that mentioned agents and teams are available in the room before creating the task.

Schedules use the timezone from `config.yaml` (defaults to UTC).

See [Scheduling](https://docs.mindroom.chat/scheduling/) for full details.

### `!list_schedules`

List pending scheduled tasks in the current room or thread.

```
!list_schedules
```

**Aliases:** `!listschedules`, `!list-schedules`, `!list_schedule`, `!listschedule`, `!list-schedule`, `!inspect_schedules`, `!inspectschedules`, `!inspect-schedules`, `!inspect_schedule`, `!inspectschedule`, `!inspect-schedule`

### `!cancel_schedule`

Cancel a specific scheduled task or all tasks in the room.

```
!cancel_schedule <task-id>
!cancel_schedule all
```

Use `!list_schedules` to find task IDs.

**Aliases:** `!cancelschedule`, `!cancel-schedule`

### `!edit_schedule`

Replace an existing scheduled task with new timing and content.

```
!edit_schedule <task-id> <new-task-description>
```

The task description is re-parsed to update timing and content.

Schedule type cannot be changed (one-time to recurring or vice versa) -- cancel and recreate instead.

**Aliases:** `!editschedule`, `!edit-schedule`

### `!model`

Show or switch the model that every agent, team, and the router uses in the current thread.

```
!model
!model list
!model opus
!model reset
```

`!model` and `!model list` show the current override and the available model names.
Model names come from the `models:` section of `config.yaml`.
The override applies from the next message in the thread and survives restarts.
Other threads and rooms keep their configured models; room-wide overrides are configured via `room_models` in `config.yaml`.
Agents can also switch the thread model themselves when they have the `thread_model` tool.

### `!thread_mode`

Show or switch how future agent replies are grouped in the current Matrix room.

```
!thread_mode
!thread_mode show
!thread_mode room
!thread_mode thread
!thread_mode reset
```

`!thread_mode` and `!thread_mode show` show the current room override.
`!thread_mode room` uses one continuous conversation for the whole room.
`!thread_mode thread` uses Matrix threads for separate conversations in this room.
`!thread_mode reset` removes the room override so agents use configured `thread_mode` and `room_thread_modes` values again.
Set and reset are Matrix room-admin-only actions.
The override is stored in MindRoom runtime state under `mindroom_data/tracking`, not in `config.yaml`, so it works when config is static or read-only.

### `!config`

View and modify MindRoom configuration from chat.
This command is disabled by default.
Set `authorization.config_command_enabled: true` to enable it.
When enabled, only users in `authorization.global_users` can use it.
Changes are validated against the Pydantic config schema before applying.

**View configuration:**

```
!config show
!config get agents
!config get models.default
!config get agents.analyst.display_name
```

**Modify configuration:**

```
!config set agents.analyst.display_name "Research Expert"
!config set models.default.id gpt-5.5
!config set defaults.markdown false
!config set timezone America/New_York
```

**Path syntax:**

- Use dot notation to navigate nested config (e.g., `agents.analyst.role`)
- Arrays use indexes (e.g., `agents.analyst.tools.0` for first tool)
- String values with spaces must be quoted

#### Confirmation flow

When you use `!config set`, MindRoom:

1. Validates the proposed change against the config schema
2. Shows a preview with the current and new values
3. Adds reaction buttons to the preview message
4. Waits for the requester to react with ✅ (confirm) or ❌ (cancel)

Only the user who requested the change can confirm or cancel it.
Pending changes are persisted in Matrix room state and survive restarts.
Unconfirmed changes expire after 24 hours.

Changes are saved to `config.yaml` immediately on confirmation and take effect for new agent interactions.

### `!reload-plugins`

Force-reload every configured plugin from disk. Admin-only.

```
!reload-plugins
```

Plugins are also auto-reloaded on file save, typically about 1-2 seconds after save — see [plugins.md / Live development](https://docs.mindroom.chat/plugins/#live-development-hot-reload) for details.
This command is the manual override: useful if the auto-watcher missed something, or to confirm a swap explicitly.

**Reply format:**

```
✅ Reloaded N plugins; cancelled K tasks; active: <plugin names>
```

**Permission:** Caller must be in `authorization.global_users`. Aliases: `!reload-plugins`, `!reload_plugins`.

## Stop Button

MindRoom supports cancelling in-progress responses via a reaction-based stop button, not a chat command.

When `defaults.show_stop_button` is `true` (the default), MindRoom adds a 🛑 reaction to the agent's message while it is generating.
React with 🛑 on the message to cancel the response.
The agent finalizes the partial text with `**[Response cancelled by user]**`.

The stop button only works on messages currently being generated.
Only non-agent users can trigger cancellation — agent reactions are ignored.

See [Streaming — Cancellation](https://docs.mindroom.chat/streaming/#cancellation-and-errors) for details on how cancelled responses are finalized.

## Unknown Commands

Any message starting with `!` that does not match a known command returns an error message suggesting `!help`.
