# Matrix Space

MindRoom can create and maintain a root Matrix Space that groups all managed rooms together.
This makes it easy for users to discover and navigate MindRoom rooms in their Matrix client.

## Configuration

```yaml
matrix_space:
  enabled: true    # Default: true
  name: MindRoom   # Default: "MindRoom"
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | Whether to create and maintain a root Matrix Space for managed MindRoom rooms |
| `name` | string | `"MindRoom"` | Display name for the root Matrix Space when enabled |

## Behavior

When `enabled` is `true`, MindRoom creates a Space on startup and adds all managed rooms as children.
Rooms created later (by agents joining new rooms or config changes) are automatically added to the Space.
MindRoom grants root Space admin power to concrete Matrix users in `authorization.global_users`.
MindRoom also grants root Space admin power to the configured `mindroom_user` when that internal account exists.
Room-specific users in `authorization.room_permissions` are not root Space admins unless they are also listed in `authorization.global_users`.
This lets owners add, remove, and reorder Space children in Matrix clients while keeping room-specific collaborators scoped to their rooms.
Root Space admin reconciliation is grant-only and preserves existing Matrix admins.
Removing a user from `authorization.global_users` stops future MindRoom authorization but does not automatically demote that user in the Space.
Demote stale Space admins manually in a Matrix client when needed.

Set `enabled: false` to disable Space creation entirely.
Disabling the setting does not delete an existing Space or remove its current child links.
The `name` field controls the Space's display name and can be changed at any time.
