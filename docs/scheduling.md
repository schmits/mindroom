# Scheduling

Schedule agents or teams to perform tasks at specific times or intervals using natural language.

By default, tasks run in the same scope where they were created: the room timeline for room-level schedules, or the current thread for threaded schedules.
The `schedule()` tool accepts `new_thread=True` to start a fresh thread per fire: each fire posts a room-level root and the responding agent answers in a new thread under it with a fresh session.

## Commands

### Schedule a Task

```
!schedule <natural-language-request>
```

**One-Time Tasks:**

```
!schedule in 5 minutes Check the deployment
!schedule tomorrow at 3pm Send the weekly report
```

**Recurring Tasks:**

```
!schedule Every hour, @shell check server status
!schedule Daily at 9am, @finance market report
!schedule Weekly on Friday, @analyst prepare weekly summary
```

**Conditional Workflows (polling-based):**

Conditional or event-like requests are converted to recurring cron-based polling schedules.

The AI picks an appropriate polling frequency based on urgency, and the condition is embedded in the task message so the scheduled responder checks it on each poll cycle.

These are **not** real event subscriptions — they are periodic checks.

```
!schedule If I get an email about "urgent", @phone_agent call me
!schedule When Bitcoin drops below $40k, @crypto_agent notify me
```

### Edit a Schedule

```
!edit_schedule <task-id> <new-task-description>
```

Edits an existing scheduled task by ID.

The task description is re-parsed to update timing and content.

### List and Cancel Schedules

```
!list_schedules                  # Show pending tasks
!cancel_schedule <task-id>       # Cancel specific task
!cancel_schedule all             # Cancel all tasks in room
```

Aliases: `!listschedules`, `!list-schedules`, `!list_schedule`, `!listschedule`, `!list-schedule`, `!inspect_schedules`, `!inspectschedules`, `!inspect-schedules`, `!inspect_schedule`, `!inspectschedule`, `!inspect-schedule`, `!cancelschedule`, `!cancel-schedule`, `!editschedule`, `!edit-schedule`

Use `!help schedule` for detailed inline help on scheduling commands.

## Agent and Team Mentions

Include `@agent_name` or `@team_name` in your schedule to have specific responders answer.

The scheduler validates that mentioned agents and teams are available in the room before creating the task.

## History Limits

Scheduled tasks normally use the responder's configured conversation history policy.
Add a context phrase when you want each run to see less of the current room or thread.
Use `with no history`, `without context`, or `context-free` when the scheduled responder should see no prior room or thread messages; the system prompt and fired task message remain available.
Use phrases such as `with only the last 5 messages of context` or `include the last 5 messages` to cap each scheduled run to recent context.

```
!schedule Every hour, @ops check deployment health with no history
!schedule Daily at 9am, @research summarize AI news with only the last 5 messages
```

For edits, omitted fields stay unchanged, including any existing history limit.
Use `restore full history` or `use unlimited history` in an edit to remove a history limit.

```
!edit_schedule task42 keep the same schedule but restore full history
!edit_schedule task42 every weekday at 8am check build status with no history
```

## Timezone

Schedules use the timezone from `config.yaml` (defaults to UTC):

```yaml
timezone: America/Los_Angeles
```

## Limitations

- **Schedule type cannot be changed** — editing a one-time task to be recurring (or vice versa) is not supported.

  Cancel the existing task and create a new one instead.
- **Conditional workflows are polling** — event-like schedules (`If ...`, `When ...`) are converted to recurring cron polls, not real event subscriptions.

## Persistence

Schedules are stored in Matrix room state and persist across restarts.

New schedules use the live runtime to start their in-memory runners immediately.

Edits are state-only Matrix writes.

Running tasks pick up edited state on their next poll instead of relying on caller-supplied cache or restart hooks.

Past one-time tasks are automatically skipped during restoration.

Only the router restores persisted schedules after startup — individual agents do not restore their own.

On shutdown, the router cancels its in-memory scheduled tasks before exiting.
