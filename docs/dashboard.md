# Web Dashboard

MindRoom includes a web dashboard for configuring agents, teams, rooms, and integrations without editing YAML files. Changes are synchronized to `config.yaml` in real-time.

## Accessing the Dashboard

**Standalone Mode:**

```bash
mindroom run
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:8765`.
When running from a source checkout, MindRoom will build the dashboard assets on first start if Bun is available.

**SaaS Platform:** Access your dashboard at `https://<instance-id>.mindroom.chat`

## Dashboard Tabs

### Dashboard (Overview)

The main dashboard shows system stats and monitoring:

- **Stats cards** - Agents (with status breakdown), rooms, teams, models, and voice status
- **Network graph** - Visual representation of agent-room-team relationships (desktop only)
- **Search and filter** - Filter by agents, rooms, or teams
- **Export Config** - Download configuration as JSON

### Agents

Configure AI agents:

- **Display name** and **Role description**
- **Model** - Select from configured models
- **Memory backend** - Inherit global memory backend or override per agent (`mem0`, `file`, or `none`)
- **Tools** - Organized into configured tools (green badge) and default tools (no config needed)
- **Instructions** - Custom behavior instructions
- **Rooms** - Where the agent operates
- **Learning** - Enable or disable Agno Learning per agent (enabled by default)
- **Learning mode** - Choose `always` (automatic extraction) or `agentic` (tool-driven)

### Teams

Configure multi-agent collaboration:

- **Display name** and **Team purpose**
- **Collaboration mode** - Coordinate (sequential) or Collaborate (parallel)
- **Team model** - Optional model override
- **Team members** and **Team rooms**

### Rooms

Manage Matrix room configuration:

- **Display name** and **Description**
- **Room model** - Optional model override
- **Agents in room** - Select which agents have access

### External Rooms

View and manage rooms that agents have joined but are not in the configuration:

- **Per-agent view** with room names and IDs
- **Bulk selection** and **Leave rooms** functionality
- **Open in Matrix** - Link to view in your Matrix client

### Models & API Keys

Configure AI model providers:

- **Add/edit models** with provider, model ID, host URL, and advanced settings
- **Provider filter** to show models by provider
- **Test connection** to verify model accessibility
- **Provider API keys** section for configuring credentials

**Runtime-supported providers:** OpenAI, Codex CLI subscription auth (`codex`), Anthropic, Google Gemini (`google`/`gemini`), Vertex AI Claude (`vertexai_claude`), Ollama, OpenRouter, Groq, DeepSeek, Cerebras

### Memory

Configure global memory defaults:

- **Backend** - Global default backend (`mem0`, `file`, or `none`)
- **Provider** - Ollama (local), OpenAI, or Sentence Transformers
- **Model** - Provider-specific embedding models
- **Host URL** - For Ollama provider
- **File backend settings** - Path and file memory tuning options
- **Auto-flush settings** - Background extraction and flush controls for file-backed memory

Per-agent overrides are configured from the **Agents** tab using the **Memory backend** selector.

### Knowledge

Manage file-backed semantic or files-only knowledge bases:

- **Create/edit/delete knowledge bases** with `description`, `mode`, `path`, and refresh-on-access `watch` settings
- **Choose semantic search or files-only access** depending on whether a base should build embeddings
- **Configure Git repository, branch, filtering, credentials service, and sync options**
- **Upload and remove files** for non-Git-backed knowledge bases
- **Reindex or sync** a knowledge base on demand
- **Track index status** (`file_count` and `indexed_count`)
- **Assign agents** to a specific knowledge base from the Agents tab

Git-backed knowledge bases are managed from the dashboard, but file mutations still belong in the repository.

- The dashboard hides upload, dropzone, and per-file delete controls for Git-backed bases.
- `/api/knowledge/bases/{base_id}/files` reflects the manager's filtered file set (for example `include_patterns`/`exclude_patterns`).
- Private HTTPS repo auth can be managed in the **Credentials** tab, then referenced by `knowledge_bases.<id>.git.credentials_service`.
- `POST /api/knowledge/bases/{base_id}/reindex` syncs Git first for Git-backed bases, then rebuilds semantic indexes or publishes files-mode source metadata.
- `POST /api/knowledge/bases/{base_id}/upload` and `DELETE /api/knowledge/bases/{base_id}/files/{path}` reject Git-backed bases with `409`; update the repository and sync or reindex instead.
- Chat/runtime requests use last successfully published indexes and do not wait for indexing or Git sync.

### Credentials

Manage service credentials directly from the dashboard:

- **List configured credential services** from `CredentialsManager`
- **Create/select service names** (for example `github_private` or `model:sonnet`)
- **Edit raw JSON credential payloads** and save via `/api/credentials/{service}`
- **Test credentials existence** using `/api/credentials/{service}/test`
- **Delete credential sets** using `/api/credentials/{service}`
- **Reuse credentials for Git knowledge sync** by setting `knowledge_bases.<id>.git.credentials_service` to the same service name
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` auto-seeds `github_private` (`username: x-access-token`, `token: <GITHUB_TOKEN>`, `_source: env`) unless the service is UI-managed

### Culture

Configure shared culture rules that apply across agents:

- **Create/edit/delete cultures** with description and mode
- **Assign agents** to cultures
- **Mode selection** - `automatic` (always active), `agentic` (agent decides when to update), or `manual` (read-only)

### Schedules

View and manage scheduled tasks across rooms:

- **List all schedules** with room, status, schedule type, and next run time
- **Edit schedule timing** and description
- **Cancel schedules** by task ID

### Skills

Manage OpenClaw-compatible skills:

- **List installed skills** with origin and edit status
- **View skill content** (SKILL.md)
- **Create new skills** with name and description
- **Edit user-created skills**
- **Delete user-created skills**

### Voice

Configure voice message handling:

- **Enable/disable** voice message support
- **Speech-to-Text** - OpenAI Whisper or self-hosted
- **Command Intelligence** - Model selection for command recognition

### Integrations

Connect external services to enable agent capabilities:

- **Categories** - Email & Calendar, Communication, Shopping, Entertainment, Social, Development, Research, Smart Home, Information
- **Search and filter** by status (Available, Unconfigured, Configured)
- **OAuth flows** for Google (6 endpoints), Spotify (4 endpoints), Home Assistant (7 endpoints), and more

## Features

### Real-time Sync

The sync status indicator in the header shows:

- **Synced** - All changes saved
- **Syncing...** - Save in progress
- **Sync Error** - Sync failed
- **Disconnected** - Lost connection to backend

### Theme and Responsive Design

Toggle between dark and light themes. The dashboard adapts to desktop and mobile devices.

## API Endpoints

The dashboard communicates with the backend API at `/api/`:

### Configuration

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/config/load` | Fetch current configuration |
| PUT | `/api/config/save` | Save full configuration |
| GET | `/api/config/raw` | Fetch the raw `config.yaml` source for recovery editing |
| PUT | `/api/config/raw` | Replace the entire raw `config.yaml` source during recovery |
| GET | `/api/config/agents` | List all agents |
| POST | `/api/config/agents` | Create new agent |
| PUT | `/api/config/agents/{id}` | Update agent |
| DELETE | `/api/config/agents/{id}` | Delete agent |
| GET | `/api/config/teams` | List all teams |
| POST | `/api/config/teams` | Create new team |
| PUT | `/api/config/teams/{id}` | Update team |
| DELETE | `/api/config/teams/{id}` | Delete team |
| GET | `/api/config/models` | List model configurations |
| PUT | `/api/config/models/{id}` | Update model configuration |
| GET | `/api/config/room-models` | Get room model overrides |
| PUT | `/api/config/room-models` | Update room model overrides |
| POST | `/api/config/agent-policies` | Get backend-derived agent policies for a draft config |

When `/api/config/load` returns validation errors, the dashboard fetches `/api/config/raw`, opens the recovery editor, and saves a full replacement through `PUT /api/config/raw` before retrying the structured reload.

### Credentials

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/credentials/list` | List services with credentials |
| GET | `/api/credentials/{service}/status` | Get credential status |
| GET | `/api/credentials/{service}` | Get credentials for editing |
| POST | `/api/credentials/{service}` | Set credentials |
| POST | `/api/credentials/{service}/api-key` | Set API key |
| GET | `/api/credentials/{service}/api-key` | Get masked API key |
| POST | `/api/credentials/{service}/test` | Test credentials validity |
| DELETE | `/api/credentials/{service}` | Delete credentials |
| POST | `/api/credentials/{service}/copy-from/{source_service}` | Copy credentials from another service |

Credentials support scoping via query parameters:

- `agent_name` — scope credentials to a specific agent
- `execution_scope` — scope credentials to a specific worker scope (e.g., `shared`, `unscoped`)

When `agent_name` is present, credential routes require the authenticated dashboard requester to be allowed by `authorization.agent_reply_permissions` for that agent.
Unauthorized agent-scoped requests return HTTP 403.
Trusted upstream deployments should provide a Matrix requester identity through the configured Matrix user ID header or email-to-Matrix template.
Standalone deployments should set `MINDROOM_OWNER_USER_ID` so API-key dashboard requests manage credentials as the owner Matrix user.

### Knowledge

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/knowledge/bases` | List configured knowledge bases |
| GET | `/api/knowledge/bases/{base_id}/files` | List files in a knowledge base |
| POST | `/api/knowledge/bases/{base_id}/upload` | Upload one or more files for a non-Git-backed base |
| DELETE | `/api/knowledge/bases/{base_id}/files/{path}` | Delete a file from disk for a non-Git-backed base and schedule refresh |
| GET | `/api/knowledge/bases/{base_id}/status` | Get indexing status |
| POST | `/api/knowledge/bases/{base_id}/reindex` | Rebuild the index for a base |

### Skills

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/skills` | List all installed skills |
| GET | `/api/skills/{skill_name}` | Get skill detail (content, origin, edit status) |
| POST | `/api/skills` | Create a new user skill |
| PUT | `/api/skills/{skill_name}` | Update a user skill's content |
| DELETE | `/api/skills/{skill_name}` | Delete a user skill |

### Schedules

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/schedules` | List scheduled tasks (filterable by room) |
| PUT | `/api/schedules/{task_id}` | Edit a scheduled task |
| DELETE | `/api/schedules/{task_id}` | Cancel a scheduled task |

### Workers

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/workers` | List active sandbox workers |
| POST | `/api/workers/cleanup` | Clean up idle sandbox workers |

### Health & Readiness

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/health` | Returns `{"status": "healthy"}` when the HTTP server is running and Matrix sync is active. Returns `503` with `{"status": "unhealthy", "stale_sync_entities": [...]}` when Matrix sync has been stale for >180s (after watchdog recovery attempts) |
| GET | `/api/ready` | Returns `{"status": "ready"}` when the orchestrator has finished startup. Returns `503` with `{"status": "<phase>", "detail": "..."}` otherwise |

MindRoom tracks runtime phases internally:

| Phase | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `idle` | Process not started |
| `starting` | Startup in progress (detail message available) |
| `ready` | Orchestrator booted, serving requests |
| `failed` | Startup or runtime failure (detail message available) |

Use `/api/health` for liveness probes and `/api/ready` for readiness probes in container orchestrators. Note: `/api/health` returns `503` when Matrix sync is stale (>180s without successful sync, after the 120s watchdog timeout has attempted recovery). Configure liveness probe `failureThreshold` to allow sufficient time for watchdog self-healing.

### Tools & Matrix

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/tools` | List available tools |
| GET | `/api/rooms` | List configured rooms |
| GET | `/api/matrix/agents/rooms` | Get all agents' room memberships |
| GET | `/api/matrix/agents/{id}/rooms` | Get specific agent's rooms |
| POST | `/api/matrix/rooms/leave` | Leave a single room |
| POST | `/api/matrix/rooms/leave-bulk` | Leave multiple rooms |
