# Support

Use this page for support requests related to MindRoom and MindRoom clients (including the iOS app).

## Contact

- General support and bug reports: [MindRoom GitHub issues](https://github.com/mindroom-ai/mindroom/issues)

Do not post access tokens, private room IDs, personal data, or safety-report evidence in a public issue.

## What to Include in a Support Request

- What you were trying to do
- What happened instead
- Screenshots or screen recordings (if available)
- Device and OS version (for mobile issues)
- App version / build number
- Homeserver URL (if relevant)

## Common Issues

### Login / Registration Problems

- Confirm the homeserver URL is correct
- Confirm the homeserver is reachable over HTTPS (for public servers)
- If using SSO, confirm the homeserver advertises the expected identity provider

### Media (Images / Audio) Not Loading

- Check connectivity to the homeserver
- Confirm your account still has access to the room/content
- Include the homeserver URL and a screenshot if possible

### Account Deactivation

- Use the in-app path: `Settings` -> `Account` -> `Delete / Deactivate Account`
- If the flow fails, include the homeserver URL and any error message shown

## Abuse / Safety Reports

Use in-app report/block tools first when available.

Do not put moderation evidence or private identifiers in a public GitHub issue.
If the in-app controls fail, open a general issue without sensitive evidence so maintainers can publish an appropriate private contact path.

Useful public context includes:

- the affected feature and client version
- a short general description with identifiers removed
- sanitized error text with tokens, Matrix IDs, room IDs, and message links removed

## Response Times

Support is provided on a best-effort basis.
