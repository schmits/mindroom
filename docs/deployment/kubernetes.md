# Kubernetes Deployment

Deploy MindRoom on Kubernetes for production multi-tenant deployments.

## Architecture

MindRoom uses three Helm charts:

- **Instance Chart** (`cluster/k8s/instance/`) - Individual MindRoom runtime with bundled dashboard/API plus Matrix/Synapse
- **Platform Chart** (`cluster/k8s/platform/`) - SaaS control plane (API, frontend, provisioner)
- **Runtime Chart** (`cluster/k8s/runtime/`) - MindRoom runtime only, for clusters that provide Matrix, storage, secrets, ingress, and platform services externally

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (tested with k3s via kube-hetzner)
- kubectl and helm installed
- NGINX Ingress Controller
- cert-manager (for TLS certificates)

## Instance Deployment

### Via Provisioner API (Recommended)

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=./cluster/terraform/terraform-k8s/mindroom-k8s_kubeconfig.yaml

# Provision, check status, view logs
./cluster/scripts/mindroom-cli.sh provision 1
./cluster/scripts/mindroom-cli.sh status
./cluster/scripts/mindroom-cli.sh logs 1
```

### Direct Helm Installation

For debugging only:

```bash
helm upgrade --install instance-1 ./cluster/k8s/instance \
  --namespace mindroom-instances \
  --create-namespace \
  --set customer=1 \
  --set accountId="your-account-uuid" \
  --set baseDomain=mindroom.chat \
  --set anthropic_key="your-key" \
  --set openrouter_key="your-key" \
  --set supabaseUrl="https://your-project.supabase.co" \
  --set supabaseAnonKey="your-anon-key" \
  --set supabaseServiceKey="your-service-key"
```

Only enable trusted upstream auth when the instance is behind a verified access layer that strips client-supplied copies of those headers and injects authenticated values itself:

```bash
helm upgrade --install instance-1 ./cluster/k8s/instance \
  --namespace mindroom-instances \
  --reuse-values \
  --set-string trustedUpstreamAuth.enabled=true \
  --set trustedUpstreamAuth.userIdHeader=X-MindRoom-User-Id \
  --set trustedUpstreamAuth.emailHeader=X-MindRoom-User-Email \
  --set trustedUpstreamAuth.matrixUserIdHeader=X-MindRoom-Matrix-User-Id \
  --set trustedUpstreamAuth.emailToMatrixUserIdTemplate='@{localpart}:example.org'
```

When using the provisioner, configure the platform chart with `provisioner.trustedUpstreamAuth.enabled="true"` and the matching `provisioner.trustedUpstreamAuth.*Header` values.
If your access layer cannot supply a Matrix ID header, configure `provisioner.trustedUpstreamAuth.emailToMatrixUserIdTemplate` with the same template.
The email-to-Matrix template must contain exactly one `{localpart}` placeholder and requires the matching `emailHeader` value in both the instance and platform chart configuration.

## Runtime-Only Deployment

Use the runtime chart when you already operate the surrounding platform and only want Kubernetes to run the MindRoom runtime.

The chart intentionally does not create Matrix, ingress, a model gateway, or platform services.

```bash
helm upgrade --install mindroom-runtime ./cluster/k8s/runtime \
  --namespace mindroom \
  --create-namespace \
  -f runtime-values.yaml
```

Typical production values point at existing resources:

```yaml
config:
  create: false
  existingConfigMap: mindroom-config
  key: config.yaml

storage:
  create: false
  existingClaim: mindroom-data

matrix:
  homeserverUrl: http://matrix.example.svc.cluster.local:8008
  serverName: example.com
  registrationToken:
    existingSecret: mindroom-secrets
    key: MATRIX_REGISTRATION_TOKEN

env:
  envFrom:
    - secretRef:
        name: mindroom-secrets

workers:
  backend: kubernetes
  sandbox:
    proxyToken:
      existingSecret: mindroom-sandbox-proxy
      key: MINDROOM_SANDBOX_PROXY_TOKEN
```

See `cluster/k8s/runtime/README.md` and `cluster/k8s/runtime/values.yaml` for the full values surface.

## Worker Backends

The instance and runtime charts support two worker backend modes for worker-routed tools such as `shell`, `file`, and `python`.

The dedicated-worker provisioning flow is implemented today.

Both modes store agent data in the same per-agent directory structure.

| Helm value | Behavior | Best for |
|------------|----------|----------|
| `workerBackend: static_runner` | Runs one shared sandbox-runner sidecar inside the main MindRoom pod | Simpler deployments |
| `workerBackend: kubernetes` | Creates dedicated worker Deployments and Services on demand | Stronger runtime isolation per agent (filesystem isolation depends on `worker_scope`) |

### Shared Sidecar Mode

`workerBackend: static_runner` is the default.
The primary runtime talks to a shared sidecar over `localhost`.
This keeps the deployment simple, but all proxied tool calls share the same runner process.
The runner reads and writes the same agent storage directories as the main process.
When encrypted credential storage is enabled in Helm, configure the credential encryption key through a Secret-backed chart value so the primary runtime and static runner sidecar receive the same key.

### Dedicated Worker Mode

`workerBackend: kubernetes` enables the built-in Kubernetes worker backend.
The primary runtime creates worker Deployments and Services on demand and routes tool calls to the matching worker.
Each worker pod runs the sandbox-runner app and accesses the same agent storage directory as every other runtime for that agent.
Worker-local files (caches, virtualenvs, metadata) are kept separate per worker.
When a worker is idle, its Deployment scales to zero, but agent data and worker caches are preserved.
The runtime chart stores derived worker tokens and optional credential-encryption keys as per-worker entries in one chart-created worker-auth Secret when workers run in the release namespace.
If `workers.kubernetes.namespace` is set to a separate worker namespace, the runtime chart can instead manage per-worker auth Secrets in that namespace.
The hosted instance chart stores derived worker tokens and optional credential-encryption keys as per-worker entries in a pre-created tenant auth Secret.
The hosted instance worker-manager Role does not grant broad Secret API access in the shared `mindroom-instances` namespace.

> [!WARNING]
> **Filesystem isolation depends on `worker_scope`.**
> With `shared`, `user_agent`, or unscoped execution, each worker can only see its own agent's storage directory — this is the strongest isolation available.
> With `user`, the worker can see all agents' storage because it shares one runtime across multiple agents for a single user.
> Use `user_agent` for per-agent filesystem isolation.

Typical Helm values look like:

```yaml
workerBackend: kubernetes
workerCleanupIntervalSeconds: 30
storageAccessMode: ReadWriteMany
controlPlaneNodeName: ""
kubernetesWorkerImage: ""
kubernetesWorkerImagePullPolicy: ""
kubernetesWorkerServiceAccountName: ""
kubernetesWorkerNamePrefix: "mindroom-worker"
kubernetesWorkerStorageSubpathPrefix: "workers"
kubernetesWorkerPort: 8766
kubernetesWorkerReadyTimeoutSeconds: 60
kubernetesWorkerIdleTimeoutSeconds: 1800
sandbox_proxy_token: "replace-me"
```

The runtime chart exposes the same concepts under the nested `workers.*` values.

Important behavior and constraints:

- `kubernetesWorkerImage` and `kubernetesWorkerImagePullPolicy` default to the main MindRoom image settings when left empty.
- `workerCleanupIntervalSeconds` controls how often the primary runtime runs idle-worker cleanup.
- `kubernetesWorkerIdleTimeoutSeconds` controls when a worker is considered idle and eligible to scale down.
- `kubernetesWorkerReadyTimeoutSeconds` controls how long the primary runtime waits for a worker Deployment to become ready.
- `kubernetesWorkerPort` is the internal Service and container port used by dedicated workers.
- Dedicated workers need access to the shared instance PVC so they can reach agent storage directories.
- For `shared`, `user_agent`, and unscoped execution, mounts are narrowed to just the target agent's directory plus the worker's scratch space.
- Shared credentials are copied into each dedicated worker as needed instead of exposing the whole shared credentials directory inside agent-isolated pods.
- Dedicated workers start with no shared credentials by default.
- Only services listed in `defaults.worker_grantable_credentials` are available inside a dedicated worker.
- `google_vertex_adc` is intentionally unsupported for dedicated workers because workers do not receive ADC files or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`; keep Vertex ADC usage in the primary runtime.
- `workers.kubernetes.extraEnv` and `MINDROOM_KUBERNETES_WORKER_ENV_JSON` are filtered before reaching worker pods or startup manifests: generated worker env, runtime control env, Kubernetes backend config env, and vendor telemetry env are dropped.
- The one sandbox-control value intentionally allowed through Kubernetes worker extra env is `MINDROOM_SANDBOX_RUNNER_SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, so operators can tune runner subprocess timeouts.
- Dedicated worker runtime env stays deny-by-default for provider and arbitrary `.env` values, while basic runtime plumbing such as `PATH`, `VIRTUAL_ENV`, and linker vars is set separately.
- This matches the broader sandbox-proxy contract for `python` and `shell`: proxied execution is intentionally stricter than direct local execution and does not inherit ordinary runtime `.env` or provider env by default.
- For agent-editable per-workspace env (extra PATH entries, package indexes, npm cache dirs, etc.), use the request-time `.mindroom/worker-env.sh` overlay documented in [Sandbox Proxy Isolation](sandbox-proxy.md#workspace-env-hook-mindroomworker-envsh). The overlay is sourced inside the running worker per request, so it does not change the worker Deployment, the startup manifest, the pod-template hash, or any Helm value, and does not require a worker restart when edited.
- MindRoom-owned workspace identity, cache, and virtualenv env names remain controlled by the worker runtime and cannot be redirected by `.mindroom/worker-env.sh`: `HOME`, `MINDROOM_AGENT_WORKSPACE`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `PIP_CACHE_DIR`, `UV_CACHE_DIR`, `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX`, and `VIRTUAL_ENV`.
- Worker-local caches may still live under `kubernetesWorkerStorageSubpathPrefix/<worker-dir>/`.

### Storage Requirements

Dedicated workers need access to the same PVC as the primary runtime.
Set `storageAccessMode: ReadWriteMany` so multiple workers can access agent storage concurrently.
If your storage class only supports `ReadWriteOnce`, set `controlPlaneNodeName` so the control plane and dedicated workers stay on the same node.
The chart enforces this constraint during template rendering.

### RBAC And Network Policy

When `workerBackend: kubernetes` is enabled, the chart creates:

- A worker-manager ServiceAccount for the primary runtime.
- A Role and RoleBinding that allow managing worker Deployments and Services in the instance namespace.
- In the runtime chart's default same-namespace mode, a chart-created worker-auth Secret plus narrow `get` and `patch` access to only that Secret.
- In the runtime chart's explicit separate worker namespace mode, Secret CRUD for per-worker auth Secrets in that worker namespace.
- In the hosted instance chart, a pre-created tenant worker-auth Secret plus narrow `get` and `patch` access to only that Secret.
- NetworkPolicy rules that allow the primary runtime to reach the internal worker port while denying worker-to-worker runner ingress.

### Operations

The authenticated dashboard API exposes `/api/workers` to list active or idle workers and `/api/workers/cleanup` to trigger cleanup manually.
Dedicated workers are internal-only cluster Services and are authenticated with per-worker runner tokens derived from the primary runtime's `sandbox_proxy_token`.
See [Sandbox Proxy Isolation](sandbox-proxy.md) for the execution model, credential leases, and non-Kubernetes deployment modes.

## Secrets Management

API keys are mounted as files at `/etc/secrets/` (not environment variables). MindRoom reads paths from `*_API_KEY_FILE` environment variables:

```yaml
env:
  - name: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_FILE
    value: "/etc/secrets/anthropic_key"
  - name: OPENROUTER_API_KEY_FILE
    value: "/etc/secrets/openrouter_key"
```

## Ingress

Each instance gets three hosts:

- `{customer}.{baseDomain}` - MindRoom dashboard and API
- `{customer}.api.{baseDomain}` - Direct API access
- `{customer}.matrix.{baseDomain}` - Matrix/Synapse server

## Platform Deployment

```bash
# Create values file from example
cp cluster/k8s/platform/values-staging.example.yaml cluster/k8s/platform/values-staging.yaml
# Edit with your configuration

helm upgrade --install platform ./cluster/k8s/platform \
  -f ./cluster/k8s/platform/values-staging.yaml \
  --namespace mindroom-staging
```

The namespace must match `mindroom-{environment}` where `environment` is set in values.

Platform ingress hosts:

- `app.{domain}` - Platform frontend
- `api.{domain}` - Platform backend API
- `webhooks.{domain}/webhooks/stripe` - Stripe webhooks

## Local Development with Kind

```bash
just cluster-kind-fresh              # Start cluster with everything
just cluster-kind-port-frontend      # http://localhost:3000
just cluster-kind-port-backend       # http://localhost:8000
just cluster-kind-down               # Clean up
```

See `cluster/k8s/kind/README.md` for details.

## CLI Helper

```bash
./cluster/scripts/mindroom-cli.sh list              # List instances
./cluster/scripts/mindroom-cli.sh status            # Overall status
./cluster/scripts/mindroom-cli.sh logs <id>         # View logs
./cluster/scripts/mindroom-cli.sh provision <id>    # Create instance
./cluster/scripts/mindroom-cli.sh deprovision <id>  # Remove instance
./cluster/scripts/mindroom-cli.sh upgrade <id>      # Upgrade instance
```

Reads configuration from `saas-platform/.env`.

## Provisioner API

All endpoints require bearer token (`PROVISIONER_API_KEY`).

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/system/provision` | POST | Create or re-provision an instance |
| `/system/instances/{id}/start` | POST | Start a stopped instance |
| `/system/instances/{id}/stop` | POST | Stop a running instance |
| `/system/instances/{id}/restart` | POST | Restart an instance |
| `/system/instances/{id}/uninstall` | DELETE | Remove an instance |
| `/system/sync-instances` | POST | Sync states between DB and K8s |

Example provision request:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.mindroom.chat/system/provision" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PROVISIONER_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"account_id": "uuid", "subscription_id": "sub-123", "tier": "starter"}'
```

The provisioner creates the namespace, generates URLs, deploys via Helm, and updates status in Supabase.
For provisioned instance charts, set `provisioner.instanceCredentialsEncryptionSecret` to a stable high-entropy value so the provisioner can derive stable per-instance `credentials_encryption_key` chart values.
If `provisioner.instanceCredentialsEncryptionSecret` is unset, the provisioner falls back to `PROVISIONER_API_KEY` when generating keys for new instances or explicit existing-instance opt-ins.
Keep this source stable because changing it changes future derived credential encryption keys.
New provisioned instances receive a derived credential encryption key by default.
When re-provisioning an existing instance, the provisioner preserves the current encryption state by reusing `credentials_encryption_key` from the existing instance Secret when present.
To enable credential encryption for an existing keyless instance, include `"enable_credentials_encryption": true` in the `POST /system/provision` request body.
Treat that opt-in as a one-way switch until a plaintext migration exists.
If an existing instance still has plaintext credential files, enabling credential encryption makes those files unreadable and encrypted-mode saves refuse to overwrite them.
Clear or replace stale plaintext credential files before enabling the flag.
If an already-encrypted instance has lost its instance Secret, pass `"enable_credentials_encryption": true` during reprovisioning so Helm receives the stable derived key again.

## Deployment Scripts

```bash
cd saas-platform
./deploy.sh platform-frontend          # Deploy platform frontend
./deploy.sh platform-backend           # Deploy platform backend
./redeploy-mindroom.sh         # Redeploy all customer MindRoom instances
```

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

Each customer instance gets:

- Separate Kubernetes deployment in `mindroom-instances` namespace
- Isolated PersistentVolumeClaim for data
- Own Matrix/Synapse server (SQLite)
- Independent ConfigMap configuration
- Dedicated ingress routes

Platform services run in `mindroom-{environment}` namespace.
