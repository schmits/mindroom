# Trusted Upstream Browser Auth

Use trusted upstream auth when MindRoom API and browser routes sit behind a deployment-owned access layer that has already authenticated the human.
This mode is disabled by default.
Do not enable it unless the reverse proxy or identity gateway strips client-supplied copies of the trusted headers and injects verified values itself.
Header-only mode is a compatibility option for deployments where MindRoom is only reachable through that trusted gateway.
Prefer strict JWT mode when the gateway can provide a signed upstream assertion.

## Why It Exists

Agent-issued OAuth links are normal browser links such as `/api/oauth/google_drive/authorize?connect_token=...`.
The connect token records the Matrix requester that triggered the missing-credentials tool result.
In a hosted multi-user private-agent deployment, the browser opening that link must authenticate as the same requester.
The standalone `MINDROOM_OWNER_USER_ID` setting maps every dashboard request to one Matrix user, so it is only appropriate for single-owner deployments.
It is not a hosted multi-user identity solution.

## Environment

Configure the header names that your access layer owns:

```bash
MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_AUTH_ENABLED=true
MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_USER_ID_HEADER=X-MindRoom-User-Id
MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_EMAIL_HEADER=X-MindRoom-User-Email
MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_MATRIX_USER_ID_HEADER=X-MindRoom-Matrix-User-Id
MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_EMAIL_TO_MATRIX_USER_ID_TEMPLATE='@{localpart}:example.org'
```

`MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_USER_ID_HEADER` is required when trusted upstream auth is enabled.
The user ID value must be stable for the authenticated browser user.
`MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_EMAIL_HEADER` is optional unless header-only auth uses `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_EMAIL_TO_MATRIX_USER_ID_TEMPLATE`.
When the email-to-Matrix template is set without strict JWT mode, `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_EMAIL_HEADER` is required because MindRoom derives the Matrix localpart from that trusted email value.
When present, the email value is stored in `request.scope["auth_user"]["email"]`.
`MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_MATRIX_USER_ID_HEADER` is optional for shared dashboard access.
For private `user` and `user_agent` OAuth flows, the trusted identity must resolve to the requester identity used by Matrix-backed tool execution.
Prefer `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_MATRIX_USER_ID_HEADER` when your access layer can supply a real Matrix ID.
When the access layer only supplies email, set `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_EMAIL_TO_MATRIX_USER_ID_TEMPLATE` to derive the Matrix ID from the trusted email localpart.
For example, the template `@{localpart}:example.org` maps `alice@example.com` to `@alice:example.org`.
The template must contain exactly one `{localpart}` placeholder.
Derived Matrix IDs must pass MindRoom's Matrix user ID parser.

## Strict JWT Mode

Strict mode requires each trusted-upstream request to carry both the configured identity headers and a signed JWT from the upstream gateway.
Enable it when the gateway publishes a JWKS endpoint and issues short-lived assertions for authenticated browser requests.
In strict mode, spoofing the trusted identity header alone is not enough because MindRoom verifies the JWT signature, expiry, issuer, audience, and configured email claim before accepting the request.

```bash
MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_REQUIRE_JWT=true
MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWT_HEADER=X-Trusted-Jwt
MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWKS_URL=https://gateway.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWT_AUDIENCE=mindroom-dashboard
MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWT_ISSUER=https://gateway.example.com
MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWT_EMAIL_CLAIM=email
MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWT_USER_ID_CLAIM=sub
MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWT_MATRIX_USER_ID_CLAIM=matrix_user_id
```

`MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_REQUIRE_JWT` is disabled by default to preserve existing header-only deployments.
When it is set to true, `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWT_HEADER`, `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWKS_URL`, `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWT_AUDIENCE`, and `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWT_ISSUER` are required.
`MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWT_EMAIL_CLAIM` defaults to `email`.
Set `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWT_USER_ID_CLAIM` when the trusted user ID header contains a stable ID that is distinct from the email address.
Set `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWT_MATRIX_USER_ID_CLAIM` when the trusted Matrix user ID header contains a Matrix identity that should be accepted in strict mode.
MindRoom caches the JWKS response briefly and refreshes it automatically so key rotation can take effect without fetching keys on every request.
If the JWT is missing, expired, signed by an unknown key, issued by the wrong issuer, meant for the wrong audience, missing a configured identity claim, or inconsistent with a configured trusted identity header, MindRoom returns `401`.
When `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWT_USER_ID_CLAIM` is set, the trusted user ID header must match that verified JWT claim.
When `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWT_USER_ID_CLAIM` is not set, the trusted user ID header must match the verified email claim because no separate signed user ID is available.
When a trusted email header is configured, that email value must match `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWT_EMAIL_CLAIM`.
When `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_JWT_MATRIX_USER_ID_CLAIM` is set, `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_MATRIX_USER_ID_HEADER` must match that verified JWT claim.
When no Matrix user ID claim is configured, strict mode only accepts a Matrix identity derived from the verified email via `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_EMAIL_TO_MATRIX_USER_ID_TEMPLATE`.
That derivation can use the verified JWT email claim even when `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_EMAIL_HEADER` is not configured.
When no Matrix user ID claim or email-to-Matrix template is configured, strict mode rejects `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_MATRIX_USER_ID_HEADER` because that header is not backed by a signed identity.

## Personal Connections Portal

Set `MINDROOM_CONNECTIONS_AGENT` to the name of a private agent to enable `/connections`.
The portal lets each authenticated user connect only the OAuth services they want for their personal agent.
Services come from that agent's available tools, including deferred tools and registered plugin or MCP OAuth providers.
Each card loads independently, so a failed or unconnected service does not block the others.
The portal does not expose model configuration, generic credential editing, or OAuth client administration.

```bash
MINDROOM_CONNECTIONS_AGENT=personal
MINDROOM_PUBLIC_URL=https://assistant.example.org
```

Configure strict JWT authentication as described above, including a signed Matrix user ID claim or a mapping from verified email.
The portal rejects header-only, standalone API-key, and owner-identity fallback authentication.
The selected agent must use `private.per: user` or `private.per: user_agent`:

```yaml
agents:
  personal:
    display_name: Personal Mind
    role: Personal assistant
    private:
      per: user_agent
    access:
      users: ["@*:example.org"]
    tools:
      - google_drive
      - name: google_calendar
        defer: true
```

Portal access requires an explicit matching `access.users` grant or configured administrator authority.
Room-membership grants alone do not grant portal access because browser requests have no conversation membership context.
The server resolves canonical Matrix aliases and the configured private scope; the browser cannot choose another user, agent, or credential target.
Existing requester-only provider rules still apply.
Account linking and disconnect reuse the same OAuth state, callback, token store, and reset lifecycle used by tools.
Operators still configure OAuth clients; shared service accounts are not displayed as personal connections.

When the portal is enabled, upstream users without administrator authority cannot access administrator APIs or dashboard pages.
Existing state-bound OAuth callback, success, and reset pages remain available for account linking.
To share a hostname with another frontend, forward `/connections`, `/connections/*`, `/api/connections`, `/api/connections/*`, and the existing `/api/oauth/*` routes to the MindRoom API.
Keep these routes behind the authenticated upstream and exclude `/connections` from any other application's service-worker navigation fallback.
Portal assets are served under `/connections/assets/`; root `/assets/` can continue serving the other application.
Use a runtime build containing the portal before enabling the routes.

Connect and disconnect requests require an HTTPS public origin and a same-origin `Origin` header matching `MINDROOM_PUBLIC_URL`, or the request base URL when unset.
The portal API returns private, non-cacheable account status and never returns token or OAuth client configuration.
The optional [Personal MCP Gateway](personal-mcp-gateway.md) reuses these accounts to expose assigned tools to external MCP clients.
Its machine endpoints use separate gateway OAuth bearer authentication; the browser consent page uses this same signed login.

## Instance Chart

For the hosted instance chart, configure the equivalent values:

```yaml
trustedUpstreamAuth:
  enabled: "true"
  userIdHeader: X-MindRoom-User-Id
  emailHeader: X-MindRoom-User-Email
  matrixUserIdHeader: X-MindRoom-Matrix-User-Id
  emailToMatrixUserIdTemplate: "@{localpart}:example.org"
  requireJwt: "true"
  jwtHeader: X-Trusted-Jwt
  jwksUrl: https://gateway.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
  jwtAudience: mindroom-dashboard
  jwtIssuer: https://gateway.example.com
  jwtEmailClaim: email
  jwtUserIdClaim: sub
  jwtMatrixUserIdClaim: matrix_user_id
```

The chart renders these values as the `MINDROOM_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_*` runtime environment variables.
The instance chart fails rendering when `trustedUpstreamAuth.emailToMatrixUserIdTemplate` is set without `trustedUpstreamAuth.emailHeader`.
The instance chart also fails rendering when `trustedUpstreamAuth.requireJwt` is true without `jwtHeader`, `jwksUrl`, `jwtAudience`, or `jwtIssuer`.
The template value must contain exactly one `{localpart}` placeholder.
When using the platform provisioner, configure the platform chart with matching provisioner values:

```yaml
provisioner:
  trustedUpstreamAuth:
    enabled: "true"
    userIdHeader: X-MindRoom-User-Id
    emailHeader: X-MindRoom-User-Email
    matrixUserIdHeader: X-MindRoom-Matrix-User-Id
    emailToMatrixUserIdTemplate: "@{localpart}:example.org"
    requireJwt: "true"
    jwtHeader: X-Trusted-Jwt
    jwksUrl: https://gateway.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
    jwtAudience: mindroom-dashboard
    jwtIssuer: https://gateway.example.com
    jwtEmailClaim: email
    jwtUserIdClaim: sub
    jwtMatrixUserIdClaim: matrix_user_id
```

The platform chart renders these as `INSTANCE_TRUSTED_UPSTREAM_*` variables on the provisioner deployment.
The platform chart fails rendering when `provisioner.trustedUpstreamAuth.emailToMatrixUserIdTemplate` is set without `provisioner.trustedUpstreamAuth.emailHeader`.
The platform chart also fails rendering when `provisioner.trustedUpstreamAuth.requireJwt` is true without `jwtHeader`, `jwksUrl`, `jwtAudience`, or `jwtIssuer`.

## Security Boundary

Trusted upstream auth is provider-neutral.
A reverse proxy, ingress controller, OAuth2 proxy, or another gateway can provide the headers as long as MindRoom only receives gateway-verified values.
Never expose a MindRoom instance with this mode enabled directly to browsers or the public internet.
In header-only mode, every network path to MindRoom must remove any client-provided copies of the trusted headers before adding authenticated values.
In strict JWT mode, the same header-stripping requirement still applies, and MindRoom additionally validates the signed assertion.
If the configured trusted user ID header is missing, MindRoom returns `401`.
If strict JWT mode is enabled and the configured JWT header is missing or invalid, MindRoom returns `401`.
If a trusted browser identity does not map to the Matrix requester stored in an OAuth connect token, MindRoom returns `403`.
Existing Supabase platform auth and standalone API-key auth remain available when trusted upstream auth is not enabled.
