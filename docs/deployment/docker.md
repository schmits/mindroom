# Docker Deployment

Deploy MindRoom using Docker for simple, containerized deployments.

## Quick Start

MindRoom ships as a single runtime container that serves:

- the bot orchestrator
- the dashboard UI at `http://localhost:8765`
- the dashboard API at `http://localhost:8765/api`
- the OpenAI-compatible API at `http://localhost:8765/v1`

Run it with:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name mindroom \
  -p 8765:8765 \
  -v ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml:ro \
  -v ./mindroom_data:/app/mindroom_data \
  --env-file .env \
  ghcr.io/mindroom-ai/mindroom:latest
```

## Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  mindroom:
    image: ghcr.io/mindroom-ai/mindroom:latest
    container_name: mindroom
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8765:8765"
    volumes:
      - ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml:ro
      - ./mindroom_data:/app/mindroom_data
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - MINDROOM_STORAGE_PATH=/app/mindroom_data
      - LOG_LEVEL=${LOG_LEVEL:-INFO}
      - MATRIX_HOMESERVER=${MATRIX_HOMESERVER}
      # Optional: for self-signed certificates
      # - MATRIX_SSL_VERIFY=false
      # Optional: override server name for federation
      # - MATRIX_SERVER_NAME=example.com
```

Run with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Environment Variables

Key environment variables (set in `.env` or pass directly):

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MATRIX_HOMESERVER` | Matrix server URL | `http://localhost:8008` |
| `MATRIX_SSL_VERIFY` | Verify SSL certificates | `true` |
| `MATRIX_SERVER_NAME` | Server name for federation (optional) | - |
| `MINDROOM_STORAGE_PATH` | Data storage directory | Relative to config file |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level | `INFO` |
| `MINDROOM_LOGGER_LEVELS` | Optional per-logger overrides, for example `mindroom:DEBUG,httpx:WARNING,httpcore:WARNING,anthropic:INFO,nio:WARNING`; set `nio.crypto:WARNING` to inspect Matrix crypto decrypt warnings | - |
| `MINDROOM_CONFIG_PATH` | Path to config.yaml | `./config.yaml`, then `~/.mindroom/config.yaml` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key (if using Claude models) | - |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key (if using OpenAI models) | - |
| `MINDROOM_PORT` | Port used by Google OAuth callback URL construction and deployment tooling. Does **not** change the API server bind port — use `mindroom run --api-port` for that | `8765` |
| `MINDROOM_API_KEY` | API key for dashboard auth (standalone) | - (open access) |

To change the API server port or bind address, pass `--api-port` or `--api-host` to the `mindroom run` command.
For example, add `command: ["mindroom", "run", "--api-port", "9000"]` to the Docker Compose service.

Streaming responses are configured in `config.yaml` via `defaults.enable_streaming` (default: `true`).

If `MINDROOM_API_KEY` is set, the browser dashboard will prompt for the key via a same-origin login page before loading the UI.

## Building from Source

Build from the repository root:

```bash
docker build -t mindroom:dev -f local/instances/deploy/Dockerfile.mindroom .
```

The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build with `uv` for dependency management and runs as a non-root user (UID 1000).

A `Dockerfile.mindroom-minimal` variant is also available, which builds a smaller image without pre-installed tool extras -- useful for sandbox runners.

## With Local Matrix

For development, run MindRoom alongside a local Matrix server:

```bash
# Start Matrix (Synapse + Postgres + Redis)
cd local/matrix && docker compose up -d

# Verify Matrix is running
curl -s http://localhost:8008/_matrix/client/versions

# Start MindRoom using the docker-compose.yml you created above
docker compose up -d
```

The local Matrix stack includes:

- **Synapse**: Matrix homeserver on port 8008
- **PostgreSQL**: Database backend
- **Redis**: Caching layer

If you're running the backend on the host (not in Docker), you can use `mindroom local-stack-setup` to start Synapse + MindRoom Chat and persist local Matrix env vars automatically:

```bash
mindroom local-stack-setup --synapse-dir /path/to/mindroom-stack/local/matrix
mindroom run
```

## Health Checks

The container exposes a health endpoint on port 8765:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8765/api/health
```

## Data Persistence

MindRoom stores data in the `mindroom_data` directory:

- `sessions/` - Per-agent conversation history (SQLite)
- `learning/` - Per-agent Agno Learning state (SQLite, persistent across restarts)
- `chroma/` - ChromaDB vector store for agent/team memories
- `knowledge_db/` - Knowledge base vector stores
- `culture/` - Shared culture state
- `tracking/` - Durable response, callback-obligation, and lifecycle-hook state used to prevent duplicate work across restarts
- `credentials/` - Synchronized secrets from `.env`
- `logs/` - Application logs
- `matrix_state.yaml` - Matrix connection state
- `encryption_keys/` - Matrix E2EE keys (if enabled)

Keep `tracking/` on persistent storage and include it in backups.
Dispatch-obligation databases retain one compact terminal row per settled callback except successful invites, whose synthetic obligations are deleted so later re-invites can run.
The retained terminal rows have no automatic retention window because deleting them weakens replay deduplication.
Pending rows temporarily retain the full event replay payload and should represent only actively deferred or retry-owned work, not completed ignore paths.
Checkpoint invalidation can force a no-`since` limited sync that backfills older events, and opaque Matrix tokens provide no safe ordering frontier for pruning those exact keys.
Size and monitor the volume for lifetime callback growth, and use the inspection and corruption-remediation guidance in [Bot Runtime Architecture](../architecture/bot-runtime.md#durable-dispatch-boundary).

## Sandbox Proxy Isolation

When configured, `coding`, `docker`, `file`, `python`, and `shell` tool calls can be proxied to a separate **sandbox-runner** sidecar container.
The sidecar runs the same image but without access to secrets, credentials, or the primary data volume.
This provides real process-level isolation for code-execution tools.
In a simple local static-runner install with no proxy URL, execution tools continue to run in the MindRoom process.
When routing is explicitly requested or a dedicated worker backend is configured, misconfigured worker routing fails closed instead of silently falling back to the primary runtime.

See [Sandbox Proxy Isolation](sandbox-proxy.md) for full documentation including Docker Compose examples, Kubernetes shared-sidecar and dedicated-worker modes, host-machine-with-container mode, credential leases, and environment variable reference.

> [!TIP]
> For production, use a reverse proxy (Traefik, Nginx) in front of the MindRoom container when you want TLS, host routing, or additional auth layers. See `local/instances/deploy/docker-compose.yml` for an example with Traefik labels.
