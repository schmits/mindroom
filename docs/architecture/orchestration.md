# Agent Orchestration

The `MultiAgentOrchestrator` (in `src/mindroom/orchestrator.py`) manages the lifecycle of all agents, teams, and the router.

```

**Key details:**

- **Entity order**: Router first, then agents, then teams
- **Room setup** (`_setup_rooms_and_memberships`): Router creates rooms, invites agents, teams, and users, then bots join
- **Sync loops**: Each bot runs `sync_forever_with_restart()` with automatic retry
- **Internal user identity**: `mindroom_user.username` is the account-creation request; runtime authorization uses the persisted actual Matrix ID

## Hot Reload

Config changes are detected via polling (`watch_file()` checks `st_mtime` every second):

1. On change, `ConfigReloadLifecycle.request_reload()` queues a debounced reload that first drains in-flight responses (forcing through after a timeout)
2. `ConfigReloadLifecycle.update_config()` loads the new config and `_identify_entities_to_restart()` computes the diff using `model_dump(exclude_none=True)`
3. The orchestrator applies the resulting plan: affected entities are stopped, recreated, and restarted
4. Removed entities run `cleanup()` (leave rooms, stop bot)
5. New/restarted bots go through room setup

Skills are watched separately via `_watch_skills_task()` with cache invalidation.

## Orchestration Subpackage

The `src/mindroom/orchestration/` subpackage contains helpers extracted from the monolithic orchestrator:

- **`runtime.py`** — Sync loop helpers: `sync_forever_with_restart()` with linear backoff (capped at 60s), `cancel_task()`, and `create_logged_task()` for safe asyncio task creation.
- **`config_lifecycle.py`** — Debounced config-reload lifecycle: `ConfigReloadLifecycle` owns reload queueing, response draining, and the load → diff → plan sequencing, dispatching the plan back to the orchestrator to apply.
- **`config_updates.py`** — Config diffing and reload planning: `build_config_update_plan()` computes a `ConfigUpdatePlan` by calling `_identify_entities_to_restart()`, which diffs old and new configs using `model_dump(exclude_none=True)`.
- **`plugin_watch.py`** — Plugin hot-reload watcher: `watch_plugins_task()` polls configured plugin roots, with `PluginWatchState` owning the watcher baselines and dirty-state revision.
- **`rooms.py`** — Room invitation helpers: `get_authorized_user_ids_to_invite()` and `get_root_space_user_ids_to_invite()` compute which users should be invited to managed rooms and the root Matrix space.

### Runtime Resolution

Agent and team materialization is handled by dedicated top-level modules (not inside the `orchestration/` subpackage):

- **`src/mindroom/runtime_resolution.py`** — Resolves `ResolvedAgentRuntime` (the full set of runtime parameters for one agent instance) including `ResolvedKnowledgeBinding` for knowledge base attachment.
- **`src/mindroom/team_exact_members.py`** — Resolves `ResolvedExactTeamMembers` for team materialization via `materialize_exact_requested_team_members()`.
- **`src/mindroom/agent_policy.py`** — Resolves canonical execution policies and private-team eligibility derived from authored agent config.
- **`src/mindroom/model_loading.py`** — Owns `get_model_instance()` and provider-specific model loader selection.
- **`src/mindroom/ai_runtime.py`** — Owns agent-run input copying, queued-notice hooks, and inline-media fallback helpers used during execution.
- **`src/mindroom/agent_storage.py`** — Owns agent session and learning SQLite storage construction helpers.
- **`src/mindroom/agent_descriptions.py`** — Owns shared agent description rendering used by routing and delegation.
- **`src/mindroom/runtime_state.py`** — Shared runtime readiness state with `set_runtime_starting()`, `set_runtime_ready()`, and `set_runtime_failed()` used by health endpoints.

## Message Handling

Event callbacks are wrapped in `_create_task_wrapper()` to run as background tasks, ensuring the sync loop is never blocked.

**`_on_message` flow:**

1. Skip own messages (except voice transcriptions from router)
2. Check sender authorization and handle edits
3. Check if already responded (`ResponseTracker`)
4. Router handles commands exclusively
5. Extract message context (mentions, thread history, non-agent mention detection)
6. Skip messages from other agents (unless mentioned)
7. Router routes when no agent or team is mentioned and thread doesn't have multiple human participants
8. Check for team formation or individual response
9. Generate response and store memory

**Message edits**: When a user edits a message that already received an agent response, the agent regenerates its response for the updated content.
The agent edits its own previous reply in place rather than sending a new message.
Edits from other agents are ignored, and the feature requires that the original response event ID is tracked by the `ResponseTracker`.

**`_on_media_message`**: Handles media events (images, videos, files, and audio).
Downloads and decrypts media data, then processes it through the selected responder.
When no agent or team is mentioned, routing selects the appropriate agent or team, similar to text messages.

**`_on_reaction`**: Handles `ReactionEvent` for the interactive Q&A system (e.g., confirming or rejecting agent suggestions) and config confirmation workflows.

**Routing** (when no agent or team is mentioned): Router narrows candidates from room configuration or joined MindRoom entities, filters them by sender permissions, lets one remaining candidate answer directly, and uses `suggest_responder_for_message()` only when multiple candidates remain.
In threads where multiple non-agent users have posted, routing is skipped entirely — an explicit `@mention` is required.
Non-MindRoom bots listed in `bot_accounts` are excluded from this detection.

## Concurrency

- Each bot runs its own sync loop via `sync_forever_with_restart()`
- Sync loop failures trigger automatic restart with linear backoff (5s, 10s, 15s, ... up to 60s max)
- Event callbacks run as background tasks (never block the sync loop)
- `ResponseTracker` prevents duplicate replies
- `StopManager` handles cancellation of in-progress responses

### Graceful Shutdown

On `orchestrator.stop()`:

1. Set `self.running = False`
2. Cancel config reload task
3. Stop memory auto-flush worker
4. Shut down the per-binding knowledge refresh scheduler
5. Cancel pending bot start tasks
6. Stop the MCP manager
7. Cancel all sync tasks
8. Signal all bots to stop (`bot.running = False`)
9. Call `bot.stop()` for each bot concurrently (waits 5s for background tasks, cancels scheduled tasks, closes Matrix client)
