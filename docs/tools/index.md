# Tools

MindRoom includes 100+ built-in tools and presets that agents can use to work with files, services, external APIs, and Matrix-native workflows.

## Enabling Tools

Tools are enabled per-agent in the configuration.
Each tool entry can be a plain string or a single-key dict with inline config overrides:

```yaml
agents:
  assistant:
    display_name: Assistant
    role: A helpful assistant with file and web access
    model: sonnet
    tools:
      - file
      - shell:
          extra_env_passthrough: "DAWARICH_*"
      - github
      - duckduckgo
```

You can also assign tools to all agents globally:

```yaml
defaults:
  tools:
    - scheduler
```

`defaults.tools` are merged into each agent's own `tools` list with duplicates removed.
Set `defaults.tools: []` to disable global default tools, or set `agents.<name>.include_default_tools: false` to opt out a specific agent.
When the same tool appears in both `defaults.tools` and an agent's `tools` with inline overrides, the per-agent overrides take priority, with non-overlapping keys merged from both.
See [Per-Agent Tool Configuration](../configuration/agents.md#per-agent-tool-configuration) for the full override syntax and merge order.
Configured MCP servers also appear here as dynamic tools named `mcp_<server_id>`.
See [MCP](../mcp.md) for the `mcp_servers` config and naming rules.

## Tool Presets And Implied Tools

Some entries are config-only presets rather than runtime toolkits.
`openclaw_compat` expands to a native bundle of MindRoom tools.
Some tools also imply companion tools through `Config.IMPLIED_TOOLS`.
Today `matrix_message` implies `attachments`, so the effective tool set includes both even when only `matrix_message` is configured explicitly.

## Tool Runtime Context

When a tool runs inside a Matrix-connected agent, it receives a `ToolRuntimeContext` via a context variable.
This context carries the current `room_id`, source `thread_id`, canonical `resolved_thread_id`, `requester_id`, `agent_name`, the Matrix client, the active config, and runtime paths.
`thread_id` preserves the raw inbound thread provenance, while `resolved_thread_id` is the canonical thread scope after compatible plain replies and other transitive resolution are applied.
Tools like `matrix_message`, `matrix_room`, `thread_tags`, and `matrix_api` use this context to act on the correct room and canonical thread without the caller passing explicit IDs.
`thread_tags` can also target another authorized room, but it still checks the target room's canonical thread root and requester membership before writing the shared tag state.
`thread_tags.tag_thread()` and `thread_tags.untag_thread()` still use the active thread when the caller explicitly repeats the current `room_id`.
`thread_tags.list_thread_tags()` uses the active thread by default, but passing `room_id` without `thread_id` forces room-wide listing even from inside an active thread.
`thread_tags.list_thread_tags(tag=...)` narrows both thread-specific and room-wide responses to the requested tag only.
`thread_tags.list_thread_tags(include_tag=..., exclude_tag=...)` filters which threads are returned: `include_tag` keeps only threads with that tag, `exclude_tag` removes threads with that tag.
Both can be combined.
Unlike `tag` (which narrows the output payload), these filter which threads appear at all.
`thread_tags.list_thread_tags(exclude_tag="resolved", include_untagged=True)` lists unresolved room threads, including threads that have no tag state yet.
`include_untagged=True` forces a room-wide query and cannot be combined with `thread_id`.
It enumerates Matrix `/threads` and may stop at the 2000-root safety cap.
The response includes `include_untagged: bool` and `truncated: bool`.
Callers must check `truncated` before claiming the unresolved list is complete.
`thread_tags` also validates and normalizes predefined payload schemas for `blocked.data.blocked_by`, `waiting.data.waiting_on`, `priority.data.level`, and `due.data.deadline`.
`thread_tags` intentionally replaces the removed experimental `thread_resolution` tool and does not auto-read old `com.mindroom.thread.resolution` markers.
`matrix_api` defaults `room_id` to the active room, supports authorized cross-room targeting, never infers event IDs or state keys from thread context, and now also supports room-scoped full-text search through `action="search"`.

## Worker-Routed Execution

Some tools default to running in a sandboxed worker container instead of the primary agent process.
The current worker-routed defaults are `file`, `shell`, `python`, and `coding`.
Use [Sandbox Proxy Isolation](../deployment/sandbox-proxy.md) for deployment details and worker-scope behavior.

## Shared-Only Integrations

Some dashboard integrations are restricted to shared or unscoped execution and cannot be used by agents with isolating worker scopes.
The current shared-only integrations are `spotify`, `homeassistant`, and non-OAuth configured `mcp_<server_id>` tools.
OAuth-backed remote MCP tools are requester-scoped and can be used with isolating worker scopes.

## Automatic Dependency Installation

Each tool declares its optional Python dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
When a tool is enabled but its dependencies are missing, MindRoom can auto-install the required extra at runtime.
Set `MINDROOM_NO_AUTO_INSTALL_TOOLS=1` to disable that behavior.
