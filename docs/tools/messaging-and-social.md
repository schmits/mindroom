# Messaging & Social

Use these tools to read and send email, post into chat systems, deliver SMS or WhatsApp messages, work with social platforms, and schedule or inspect meetings.

## What This Page Covers

This page documents the built-in tools in the `messaging-and-social` group.
Use these tools when you need outbound communication, mailbox access, team-chat delivery, social/community lookups, or Zoom meeting management.

## Tools On This Page

- [`gmail`] - Gmail mailbox access and message composition through the Google Gmail OAuth provider.
- [`slack`] - Slack channel messaging, threaded replies, channel listing, and history reads.
- [`discord`] - Discord bot messaging, channel inspection, history reads, and message deletion.
- [`telegram`] - Telegram bot delivery to one configured chat.
- [`whatsapp`] - WhatsApp Business API text and template messaging.
- [`twilio`] - Twilio SMS delivery, call lookup, and recent message listing.
- [`webex`] - Webex room messaging and room listing.
- [`resend`] - Transactional email delivery through Resend.
- [`email`] - Simple SMTP email sending through Gmail SMTP.
- [`x`] - X posting, replying, DMs, profile lookup, timeline reads, and recent-post search.
- [`reddit`] - Reddit read access plus optional posting and replies with user auth.
- [`zoom`] - Zoom Server-to-Server OAuth meeting scheduling and management.

## Common Setup Notes

`gmail` uses `auth_provider="google_gmail"` and connects through the generic `/api/oauth/google_gmail/*` flow.
Its OAuth tokens are stored separately from editable Gmail tool settings.
`homeassistant` stays local even when other tools are routed through the sandbox proxy.
MindRoom enforces that restriction both at config-validation time and again during tool construction.
Password fields should be stored through the dashboard or credential store instead of inline YAML.
Several metadata fields on this page are marked `required: false`, but the installed SDKs still need the corresponding token or secret in practice.
Useful environment fallbacks on this page include `SLACK_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `WEBEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `X_BEARER_TOKEN`, `X_CONSUMER_KEY`, `X_CONSUMER_SECRET`, `X_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`, `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`, `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`, `REDDIT_USERNAME`, `REDDIT_PASSWORD`, `ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID`, `ZOOM_CLIENT_ID`, and `ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET`.
The generic-looking `email` tool is not a fully configurable SMTP client on this branch.
Its installed upstream implementation is hard-wired to Gmail SMTP over `smtp.gmail.com:465` and does not expose SMTP host, port, or TLS configuration fields.

## [`gmail`]

`gmail` is the mailbox-oriented tool for reading, searching, drafting, sending, and labeling Gmail messages through the Google Gmail OAuth provider.

### What It Does

MindRoom wraps Agno's `GmailTools` with `ScopedOAuthClientMixin`, so Gmail credentials are loaded from MindRoom's scoped OAuth credential store instead of a local `token.json` file.
The wrapper refreshes stored Google tokens when needed and raises `OAuthConnectionRequired` with a connect URL when no usable stored OAuth credentials are available.
It does not fall back to Agno's local OAuth flow when MindRoom credentials are missing.
It only bypasses MindRoom OAuth when configured for Google service-account auth.
The current installed Gmail toolkit exposes `get_latest_emails()`, `get_emails_from_user()`, `get_unread_emails()`, `get_starred_emails()`, `get_emails_by_context()`, `get_emails_by_date()`, `get_emails_by_thread()`, `search_emails()`, `create_draft_email()`, `send_email()`, `send_email_reply()`, `mark_email_as_read()`, `mark_email_as_unread()`, `list_custom_labels()`, `apply_label()`, `remove_label()`, and `delete_custom_label()`.
Draft and send operations accept local file-system paths for attachments.

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `get_latest_emails` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Declared in MindRoom's registry metadata as a capability flag. |
| `get_emails_from_user` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Declared in MindRoom's registry metadata as a capability flag. |
| `get_unread_emails` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Declared in MindRoom's registry metadata as a capability flag. |
| `get_starred_emails` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Declared in MindRoom's registry metadata as a capability flag. |
| `search_emails` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Declared in MindRoom's registry metadata as a capability flag. |
| `create_draft_email` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Declared in MindRoom's registry metadata as a capability flag. |
| `send_email` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Declared in MindRoom's registry metadata as a capability flag. |
| `send_email_reply` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Declared in MindRoom's registry metadata as a capability flag. |

### Example

```yaml
agents:
  assistant:
    worker_scope: shared
    tools:
      - gmail
```

```python
get_latest_emails(10)
search_emails("label:unread from:billing@example.com", 10)
send_email("alice@example.com", "Project update", "Here is the latest status.")
send_email_reply("thread_id", "message_id", "alice@example.com", "Re: Project update", "Thanks for the update.")
apply_label("is:unread category:promotions", "Needs Review", count=10)
```

### Notes

- Connect Gmail through the `google_gmail` OAuth provider rather than storing a Gmail-specific API key.
- The Gmail provider requests `gmail.modify`, which is the narrowest single scope that preserves mailbox reading, drafting, sending, labeling, and organization.
- `gmail` always runs in the primary MindRoom runtime so worker runtimes do not receive Google OAuth secrets.
- Agno's Gmail constructor accepts per-method selector kwargs (`get_latest_emails`, `get_unread_emails`, `search_emails`, etc.), and the MindRoom wrapper forwards them via `**kwargs`.
- Use those selector kwargs to disable specific methods you do not want the agent calling.
- Attachment arguments are local file paths in the current runtime, not Matrix attachment IDs.

## [`slack`]

`slack` is the Slack bot toolkit for posting to channels, replying in threads, listing channels, and reading recent channel history.

### What It Does

The installed upstream tool exposes `send_message()`, `send_message_thread()`, `list_channels()`, and `get_channel_history()`.
It uses Slack's `WebClient` from `slack_sdk`.
`markdown` maps to the `mrkdwn` flag on `chat_postMessage()`.
Channel-history responses are normalized into a smaller JSON structure instead of returning the full Slack API payload.

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | `password` | `no` | `null` | Slack bot token, or use `SLACK_TOKEN`. Required in practice. |
| `markdown` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable Slack markdown rendering on sent messages. |
| `enable_send_message` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `send_message()`. |
| `enable_send_message_thread` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `send_message_thread()`. |
| `enable_list_channels` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `list_channels()`. |
| `enable_get_channel_history` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `get_channel_history()`. |
| `all` | `boolean` | `no` | `false` | Enable the full upstream toolkit surface. |

### Example

```yaml
agents:
  support:
    tools:
      - slack:
          markdown: true
          enable_get_channel_history: true
```

```python
list_channels()
send_message("C0123456789", "Deployment finished.")
send_message_thread("C0123456789", "Following up in the same thread.", "1743112345.678900")
get_channel_history("C0123456789", limit=25)
```

### Notes

- Although `token` is marked optional in metadata, the installed Slack toolkit raises if no token or `SLACK_TOKEN` is present.
- Use channel IDs for the most reliable calls, especially for threaded replies and history reads.
- `get_channel_history()` returns a simplified JSON view rather than the raw Slack response.

## [`discord`]

`discord` is the Discord bot toolkit for channel messaging, channel metadata, channel history, server channel listing, and message deletion.

### What It Does

The installed upstream tool exposes `send_message()`, `get_channel_messages()`, `get_channel_info()`, `list_channels()`, and `delete_message()`.
It talks directly to `https://discord.com/api/v10` with a bot token in the `Authorization` header.
This is a raw REST wrapper rather than a gateway-connected real-time bot runtime.
Most functions expect Discord IDs such as `channel_id`, `guild_id`, and `message_id`, not display names.

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bot_token` | `password` | `no` | `null` | Discord bot token, or use `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`. Required in practice. |
| `enable_send_message` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `send_message()`. |
| `enable_get_channel_messages` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `get_channel_messages()`. |
| `enable_get_channel_info` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `get_channel_info()`. |
| `enable_list_channels` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `list_channels()`. |
| `enable_delete_message` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `delete_message()`. |
| `all` | `boolean` | `no` | `false` | Enable the full upstream toolkit surface. |

### Example

```yaml
agents:
  community:
    tools:
      - discord:
          enable_delete_message: false
```

```python
list_channels("123456789012345678")
get_channel_info("123456789012345678")
get_channel_messages("123456789012345678", limit=25)
send_message("123456789012345678", "Hello from MindRoom.")
```

### Notes

- `bot_token` is effectively required even though the metadata marks it optional.
- This tool uses ordinary Discord REST calls and does not manage slash commands, presence, or gateway subscriptions.
- Deletion is enabled by default, so disable `enable_delete_message` if you only want read and send access.

## [`telegram`]

`telegram` is the simplest chat-delivery tool on this page, with one configured destination and one send function.

### What It Does

The installed upstream tool exposes only `send_message()`.
It posts to Telegram Bot API `sendMessage` for the configured `chat_id`.
The tool instance is bound to one chat destination, so callers do not pass a chat ID per request.
Responses are returned as the raw Telegram API response text.

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `chat_id` | `text` | `yes` | `null` | Telegram chat or channel ID that this tool instance will target. |
| `token` | `password` | `no` | `null` | Telegram bot token, or use `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`. Required in practice. |
| `enable_send_message` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `send_message()`. |
| `all` | `boolean` | `no` | `false` | Enable the full upstream toolkit surface. |

### Example

```yaml
agents:
  notifier:
    tools:
      - telegram:
          chat_id: "-1001234567890"
```

```python
send_message("Nightly backup completed.")
```

### Notes

- Set both `chat_id` and `token` for a usable configuration.
- Because the destination chat is fixed in config, this tool is best for one bot-to-room delivery path rather than general multi-room Telegram automation.
- If you need different Telegram destinations, configure different agents or different tool credentials per scope.

## [`whatsapp`]

`whatsapp` is the WhatsApp Business API toolkit for text messages and template messages through Meta's Graph API.

### What It Does

The installed upstream tool can expose either `send_text_message_sync()` and `send_template_message_sync()` or their async variants, depending on `async_mode`.
It posts to `https://graph.facebook.com/<version>/<phone_number_id>/messages`.
`recipient_waid` sets a default recipient so callers can omit the `recipient` argument.
If no default recipient is configured, every send call must provide one.

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `access_token` | `password` | `no` | `null` | WhatsApp Business API token, or use `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Required in practice. |
| `phone_number_id` | `text` | `no` | `null` | WhatsApp Business phone number ID, or use `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`. Required in practice. |
| `version` | `text` | `no` | `v22.0` | Graph API version prefix. |
| `recipient_waid` | `text` | `no` | `null` | Default recipient phone number or WhatsApp ID. |
| `async_mode` | `boolean` | `no` | `false` | Register async send functions instead of sync send functions. |

### Example

```yaml
agents:
  pager:
    tools:
      - whatsapp:
          version: v22.0
          recipient_waid: "+15551234567"
          async_mode: false
```

```python
send_text_message_sync("The deployment finished.")
send_template_message_sync(template_name="deployment_notice", language_code="en_US")
```

### Notes

- Set both `access_token` and `phone_number_id` even though the metadata marks them optional.
- `async_mode: true` changes the registered function names to the async variants, which matters if you are debugging tool traces or reading model-generated tool calls.
- Template sends expect a preapproved WhatsApp template name and, optionally, template `components`.

## [`twilio`]

`twilio` is the telecom-oriented toolkit for SMS sends, call lookups, and recent message history.

### What It Does

The installed upstream tool exposes `send_sms()`, `get_call_details()`, and `list_messages()`.
It supports two auth modes: `account_sid` plus `auth_token`, or `account_sid` plus `api_key` and `api_secret`.
Optional `region` and `edge` are passed into the Twilio client for regional routing.
`send_sms()` validates that both `to` and `from_` are in E.164 format before sending.

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `account_sid` | `text` | `no` | `null` | Twilio account SID, or use `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`. Required in practice. |
| `auth_token` | `password` | `no` | `null` | Twilio auth token for the simpler auth mode. |
| `api_key` | `password` | `no` | `null` | Twilio API key for key-and-secret auth. |
| `api_secret` | `password` | `no` | `null` | Twilio API secret for key-and-secret auth. |
| `region` | `text` | `no` | `null` | Optional Twilio region such as `au1`. |
| `edge` | `text` | `no` | `null` | Optional Twilio edge such as `sydney`. |
| `debug` | `boolean` | `no` | `false` | Enable Twilio HTTP client logging. |
| `enable_send_sms` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `send_sms()`. |
| `enable_get_call_details` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `get_call_details()`. |
| `enable_list_messages` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `list_messages()`. |
| `all` | `boolean` | `no` | `false` | Enable the full upstream toolkit surface. |

### Example

```yaml
agents:
  phone_ops:
    tools:
      - twilio:
          region: au1
          edge: sydney
          enable_list_messages: true
```

```python
send_sms("+15551234567", "+15557654321", "Build passed.")
get_call_details("CA1234567890abcdef")
list_messages(limit=10)
```

### Notes

- `account_sid` is required in both supported auth modes.
- Use either `auth_token` or the `api_key` plus `api_secret` pair, not both as separate independent auth methods.
- `send_sms()` rejects non-E.164 numbers before it reaches Twilio's API.

## [`webex`]

`webex` is the Cisco Webex toolkit for room messaging and room listing.

### What It Does

The installed upstream tool exposes `send_message()` and `list_rooms()`.
It authenticates with `webexpythonsdk.WebexAPI` using one access token.
Despite the broader description in the registry, the current tool surface is messaging-centric and does not manage meetings.
Responses are returned as JSON strings built from the SDK result objects.

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enable_send_message` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `send_message()`. |
| `enable_list_rooms` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `list_rooms()`. |
| `all` | `boolean` | `no` | `false` | Enable the full upstream toolkit surface. |
| `access_token` | `password` | `no` | `null` | Webex access token, or use `WEBEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Required in practice. |

### Example

```yaml
agents:
  meetings:
    tools:
      - webex:
          enable_list_rooms: true
```

```python
list_rooms()
send_message("Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3VzL1JPT00v...", "Agenda is ready.")
```

### Notes

- Set `access_token` even though metadata marks it optional.
- The current tool surface is room messaging and room discovery only.
- Use room IDs, not room titles, when sending messages.

## [`resend`]

`resend` is the transactional-email API toolkit for HTML email delivery through Resend.

### What It Does

The installed upstream tool exposes one function, `send_email()`.
It sets `resend.api_key` on each call and sends email through `resend.Emails.send()`.
The current implementation passes the message body as HTML, not plain text.
`from_email` is stored on the tool instance and reused for every call.

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `api_key` | `password` | `no` | `null` | Resend API key, or use `RESEND_API_KEY`. Required in practice. |
| `from_email` | `text` | `no` | `null` | Sender identity used for every call. Usually required by the provider in practice. |
| `enable_send_email` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `send_email()`. |
| `all` | `boolean` | `no` | `false` | Enable the full upstream toolkit surface. |

### Example

```yaml
agents:
  mailer:
    tools:
      - resend:
          from_email: no-reply@example.com
```

```python
send_email("alice@example.com", "Welcome", "<p>Your account is ready.</p>")
```

### Notes

- `from_email` is not marked required in metadata, but most Resend setups need a verified sender.
- The `body` argument is sent as HTML.
- Use `resend` when you want provider-managed transactional delivery rather than Gmail mailbox access.

## [`email`]

`email` is the simplest SMTP mailer on this page, but on this branch it is specifically wired for Gmail SMTP rather than generic SMTP.

### What It Does

The installed upstream tool exposes one function, `email_user()`.
It builds an `EmailMessage`, then logs in with `smtplib.SMTP_SSL("smtp.gmail.com", 465)`.
That means the sender account must be a Gmail account or a Google Workspace account compatible with Gmail SMTP.
The current implementation sends plain-text bodies only.

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `receiver_email` | `text` | `no` | `null` | Default recipient for all `email_user()` calls. |
| `sender_name` | `text` | `no` | `null` | Display name shown in the `From` header. |
| `sender_email` | `text` | `no` | `null` | Gmail sender address used for SMTP login. |
| `sender_passkey` | `password` | `no` | `null` | Gmail app password or equivalent SMTP passkey. Required in practice. |
| `enable_email_user` | `boolean` | `no` | `true` | Enable `email_user()`. |
| `all` | `boolean` | `no` | `false` | Enable the full upstream toolkit surface. |

### Example

```yaml
agents:
  alerts:
    tools:
      - email:
          receiver_email: oncall@example.com
          sender_name: MindRoom Alerts
          sender_email: alerts@gmail.com
```

```python
email_user("Nightly report", "The report finished successfully.")
```

### Notes

- Despite the generic tool name, there are no host, port, TLS, or auth-mechanism overrides in the current implementation.
- This tool is best for simple Gmail-based outbound mail, not arbitrary SMTP providers.
- If you need mailbox reads, drafts, replies, or labels, use `gmail` instead.
- If you need provider-managed transactional delivery with HTML bodies, use `resend` instead.

## [`x`]

`x` is the X or Twitter toolkit for recent-post search, user lookup, timeline access, posting, replying, and DMs.

### What It Does

The installed upstream tool exposes `create_post()`, `reply_to_post()`, `send_dm()`, `get_user_info()`, `get_home_timeline()`, and `search_posts()`.
It uses `tweepy.Client` and passes through `wait_on_rate_limit`.
`search_posts()` calls `search_recent_tweets()` and, when `include_post_metrics` is enabled, augments each returned post with reply, retweet, like, and quote counts.
The implementation clamps `max_results` for search to the Twitter API's supported `10` to `100` range.

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bearer_token` | `password` | `no` | `null` | Bearer token, or use `X_BEARER_TOKEN`. |
| `consumer_key` | `password` | `no` | `null` | OAuth consumer key, or use `X_CONSUMER_KEY`. |
| `consumer_secret` | `password` | `no` | `null` | OAuth consumer secret, or use `X_CONSUMER_SECRET`. |
| `access_token` | `password` | `no` | `null` | OAuth access token, or use `X_ACCESS_TOKEN`. |
| `access_token_secret` | `password` | `no` | `null` | OAuth access token secret, or use `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`. |
| `include_post_metrics` | `boolean` | `no` | `false` | Include public metrics in `search_posts()` output. |
| `wait_on_rate_limit` | `boolean` | `no` | `false` | Let Tweepy wait for rate limits instead of failing immediately. |

### Example

```yaml
agents:
  social:
    tools:
      - x:
          include_post_metrics: true
          wait_on_rate_limit: true
```

```python
search_posts("mindroom matrix", max_results=10)
get_user_info("mindroom_ai")
create_post("MindRoom now supports another release.")
reply_to_post("1890123456789012345", "Thanks for the feedback.")
```

### Notes

- A bearer token can support read-style endpoints such as search, but posting, replying, DMs, and home-timeline access generally need full OAuth user credentials.
- The toolkit also defines `get_my_info()`, but MindRoom's current registered tool list on this branch does not advertise a separate config flag for it.
- `reply_to_post()` builds a `twitter.com` URL in its response, while `create_post()` builds an `x.com` URL, so response formatting is currently inconsistent upstream.

## [`reddit`]

`reddit` is the Reddit toolkit for reading user and subreddit data, listing trending communities, and optionally posting or replying with user credentials.

### What It Does

The installed upstream tool exposes `get_user_info()`, `get_top_posts()`, `get_subreddit_info()`, `get_trending_subreddits()`, `get_subreddit_stats()`, `create_post()`, `reply_to_post()`, and `reply_to_comment()`.
With only `client_id` and `client_secret`, the tool initializes a read-only `praw.Reddit` client.
If `username` and `password` are also configured, the tool enables posting and replying with authenticated user actions.
`reddit_instance` is an advanced programmatic injection point for an existing `praw.Reddit` object rather than a normal YAML value.

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reddit_instance` | `text` | `no` | `null` | Advanced programmatic Reddit client injection, not normal YAML authoring. |
| `client_id` | `text` | `no` | `null` | Reddit app client ID, or use `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`. Required in practice. |
| `client_secret` | `password` | `no` | `null` | Reddit app client secret, or use `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`. Required in practice. |
| `user_agent` | `text` | `no` | `null` | Optional custom user agent, with `RedditTools v1.0` as the upstream fallback. |
| `username` | `text` | `no` | `null` | Reddit username for posting and replying. |
| `password` | `password` | `no` | `null` | Reddit password for posting and replying. |

### Example

```yaml
agents:
  research:
    tools:
      - reddit:
          user_agent: MindRoomResearchBot/1.0
```

```python
get_top_posts("matrixdotorg", time_filter="week", limit=10)
get_subreddit_info("python")
get_trending_subreddits()
get_user_info("spez")
```

### Notes

- `client_id` and `client_secret` are enough for read-only operations.
- `create_post()`, `reply_to_post()`, and `reply_to_comment()` additionally require `username` and `password`.
- The current MindRoom metadata treats `reddit_instance` as text, but the upstream constructor expects an already constructed `praw.Reddit` object.

## [`zoom`]

`zoom` is the Zoom meeting-management toolkit for scheduling, listing, inspecting, deleting, and reading recordings through Zoom's Server-to-Server OAuth flow.

### What It Does

The installed upstream tool exposes `get_access_token()`, `schedule_meeting()`, `get_upcoming_meetings()`, `list_meetings()`, `get_meeting_recordings()`, `delete_meeting()`, and `get_meeting()`.
It exchanges `account_id`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` against `https://zoom.us/oauth/token` with `grant_type=account_credentials`.
The generated access token is cached in process until shortly before expiry.
Meeting creation always targets `users/me/meetings` and applies a fixed set of default meeting settings in the upstream implementation.

### Configuration

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `account_id` | `text` | `no` | `null` | Zoom account ID from a Server-to-Server OAuth app, or use `ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID`. Required in practice. |
| `client_id` | `text` | `no` | `null` | Zoom client ID, or use `ZOOM_CLIENT_ID`. Required in practice. |
| `client_secret` | `password` | `no` | `null` | Zoom client secret, or use `ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET`. Required in practice. |

### Example

```yaml
agents:
  coordinator:
    tools:
      - zoom:
          account_id: your_account_id
          client_id: your_client_id
```

```python
schedule_meeting("Weekly sync", "2026-04-02T16:00:00Z", 30, timezone="America/Los_Angeles")
get_upcoming_meetings()
list_meetings(type="scheduled")
get_meeting("81234567890")
```

### Notes

- Although MindRoom marks `zoom` as `setup_type: oauth`, the current implementation is not an interactive browser OAuth flow.
- The installed tool expects Server-to-Server OAuth credentials and exchanges them directly for an access token on demand.
- `get_meeting_recordings()` can request a download token and TTL per call, but those are call arguments rather than config fields.
