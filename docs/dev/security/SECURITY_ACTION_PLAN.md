# MindRoom Security Action Plan

**Updated:** March 18, 2026

> **Historical planning record:** This document mixes the original remediation plan with later repository audits.
> It is not a current deployment attestation or an operational runbook; revalidate every status claim against the current source and target environment before acting.

## Executive Summary

MindRoom has addressed the most acute blockers identified in the initial security review (unauthenticated admin APIs, default credentials, and missing rate limiting). However, several high-risk items remain open—most notably secrets lifecycle verification, monitoring/alerting coverage, and internal service encryption. The platform is **not yet production ready** until these gaps are closed and the residual tasks in the checklist are completed.

**Current Risk Assessment: 🟠 MEDIUM-HIGH** – Staging-only. Proceed to production **after** completing outstanding High items.

**Implementation Status (September 17, 2025):**
- ⚠️ **P0 Legal/Regulatory:** GDPR flows and a backend log sanitizer exist in tracked code, but deletion scope and global logging coverage remain incomplete.
- ⚠️ **P1.1 Auth Security:** Auth monitoring, IP blocking, and admin route protections exist in tracked code; live deployment is unverified.
- ⚠️ **P1.2 Infrastructure:** K8s Secrets mounted as files, but etcd-at-rest encryption and documented rotation remain unverified.
- ⚠️ **P2 Monitoring:** Alerting, dashboards, and incident runbooks still pending (logs available for manual review).

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (⚠️ PARTIAL)

### P0: Critical Authentication & Data Exposure Fixes

1. **ADMIN ENDPOINT AUTHENTICATION** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - **Status:** All admin endpoints properly secured with `verify_admin` dependency
   - **Implementation:** Authentication required for all administrative operations
   - **Verification:** Security review confirmed proper access controls

2. **REVOKE & ROTATE ALL EXPOSED API KEYS** 🔑 ⚠️
   - **⚠️ Obsolete helpers:** Do not run `scripts/rotate-api-keys.sh` or `scripts/apply-rotated-keys.sh`; their Secret names and keys do not match the current charts.
   - **⚠️ Pending:** Confirm actual rotation for DeepSeek, Google, and OpenRouter keys (last known exposure in docs)
   - **⚠️ Pending:** Generate and store a rotation report (no `P0_2_SECRET_ROTATION_REPORT.md` exists)
   - **Next step:** Use the current Helm, provisioner, or external-secret workflow and verify the rotation in a disposable namespace before granting production access.

3. **REMOVE .env FROM GIT HISTORY** 📝 ⚠️
   - Rewriting shared Git history is destructive and requires repository-owner coordination, a tested backup, and a repository-specific migration plan.
   - Do not copy a generic force-push command from this historical plan.

4. **DEFAULT PASSWORDS REPLACEMENT** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - **Status:** All default passwords removed from configurations
   - **Implementation:** Secrets must be supplied through the chart values or existing-Secret workflow; the platform chart does not generate strong missing secrets.
   - **Docker Compose:** Requires explicit password configuration (no defaults)
   - **Security:** No "changeme" passwords remain in tracked configs

## SECURITY IMPLEMENTATIONS AND OPEN GAPS

### P0: Legal/Regulatory Compliance (PARTIAL)

**Logging Sanitization:**
- **Frontend:** Production logger prevents all console output (`lib/logger.ts`)
- **Backend:** A PII-redacting logger exists in `utils/log_sanitizer.py`, but modules using standard-library loggers bypass it.
- **Result:** Global log-surface enforcement and verification remain outstanding.

**GDPR Compliance:**
- **Data Export:** Complete personal data export in JSON format (`/my/gdpr/export-data`)
- **Data Deletion:** Soft delete with 7-day grace period (`/my/gdpr/request-deletion`)
- **Consent Management:** User consent preferences (`/my/gdpr/consent`)
- **Result:** These application flows exist, but this document does not establish full GDPR compliance or deletion across authentication, payment, and instance-storage processors.

**Soft Delete Implementation:**
- **Database:** The consolidated schema contains soft-delete capabilities.
- **Functions:** `soft_delete_account()`, `restore_account()`, `hard_delete_account()`
- **Grace Period:** 7-day recovery window
- **Result:** Data lifecycle management with audit trail

### P1.1: Authentication Security (PARTIAL)

**Auth Failure Tracking:**
- **Implementation:** `auth_monitor.py` with module-level functions (KISS)
- **IP Blocking:** Automatic blocking after 5 failures in 15 minutes
- **Block Duration:** 30 minutes with automatic expiry
- **Audit Logging:** Uncached regular-user verification successes and failures are recorded; cache hits, admin verification, and SSO paths are not comprehensively covered.
- **Integration:** Embedded in `verify_user()` dependency
- **Result:** Protection against brute force, credential stuffing, and account enumeration

## 🔄 REMAINING ITEMS (Low Priority)

### P1.2: Infrastructure Security (⚠️ IN PROGRESS)

**Secrets lifecycle:**
- ✅ K8s secrets are mounted as read-only files at `/etc/secrets` and consumed via `_get_secret()`.
- ⚠️ Need to verify etcd-at-rest encryption for the target cluster before launch.
- ⚠️ Document a tested rotation run through the current Helm, provisioner, or external-secret workflow.

**Runtime hardening:**
- ⚠️ Platform deployments still run as root; update manifests with `securityContext` (see example below).
- ✅ Instance Helm chart already drops Linux capabilities and sets resource requests/limits.

**Example securityContext to apply:**
```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  fsGroup: 1000
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

### P2: Monitoring & IR (IN PROGRESS)

**Prometheus Configuration (PARTIAL)**
- ✅ ServiceMonitor + PrometheusRule manifests exist for auth/admin events
- ✅ Metrics exposed (`mindroom_auth_events_total`, `mindroom_admin_verifications_total`, `mindroom_blocked_ips`)
- ⚠️ Live scrape and target health require verification in the target cluster.
- ➡️ Documented in SECURITY_REVIEW_11

**Alert Routing (⚠️ TODO)**
- Configure Alertmanager receivers (email/Slack/PagerDuty)
- Produce on-call/IR runbook and notification matrix
- Publish security@ mailbox & security.txt (ties into IR comms)

**Dashboards & Reporting (⚠️ TODO / LOW)**
- Stand up Grafana/Metabase dashboards for the new metrics
- Automate weekly/monthly security reports once routing is in place

**Incident Response (⚠️ TODO)**
- Turn the draft playbook into an owned, tested procedure covering triage, escalation, and postmortems.
- Align with compliance requirements (SOC 2, GDPR breach notification)

9. **Move Secrets from Environment Variables to Volumes** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - **Status:** Already implemented in `deployment-mindroom.yaml`
   - **Implementation:** Secrets mounted as files at `/etc/secrets`
   ```yaml
   volumeMounts:
   - name: api-keys
     mountPath: /etc/secrets
     readOnly: true
   ```

## Final Status Update (September 17, 2025)

- **Risk Trend:** The historical numeric estimate was unsupported; current evidence still indicates medium-high risk, with further reduction blocked by the open items above.
- **Completed:** Admin authentication fixes, rate limiting, GDPR endpoints, log sanitization.
- **Outstanding:** Secrets rotation confirmation, monitoring alerts, internal TLS, checklist backlog.

**Platform Status:** Safe for restricted staging with trusted testers only. Do **not** expose publicly until remaining blockers are resolved and documentation is refreshed.

> **Audit note (2026-03-18):** Earlier versions published a numeric risk reduction without a scoring methodology or evidence tying specific fixes to numeric changes.
> Several items marked pending here have no target dates or responsible parties assigned.
> The P3-P8 sections originated in the original write-up and require current source and deployment validation.
