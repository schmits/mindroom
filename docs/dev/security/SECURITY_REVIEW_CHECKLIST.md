# MindRoom Security Review Checklist

> **Audit note (2026-03-18):** Some checked items in this checklist contradict the status reported in individual SECURITY_REVIEW_*.md documents and SECURITY_ACTION_PLAN.md.
> Known inconsistencies: default password removal is marked done here while secrets rotation is still pending, and monitoring items are unchecked here although Prometheus metric and alert-rule manifests exist.
> Treat the individual review docs as the more detailed source of truth.
> This is a historical checklist, not a live deployment attestation.

## Overview
This document provides a systematic security review checklist for the MindRoom beta release. Each item should be verified and documented before making the codebase open-source.

### Status Update (2025-09-12)
- Admin endpoints authenticated and rate‑limited; resource allowlist and audit logging added
- Provisioner authentication hardened (constant‑time) and rate‑limited
- Request size limit (1 MiB), core security headers, trusted hosts, and restricted CORS configured
- Per‑instance NetworkPolicy and namespaced backend RBAC applied
- Multi‑tenancy isolation fixed for webhook_events and payments (migrations + handler validation); tests added
- Defaults removed in tracked configs; platform chart secrets must be supplied through values or an existing-Secret workflow.
- Remaining: verify etcd encryption (K8s Secrets already implemented with file mounts), monitoring/alerts and IR playbook, internal TLS/mTLS (optional for MVP)

## Critical Issues Found (Immediate Action Required)
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Default Matrix admin password is set to "changeme" in `cluster/k8s/instance/values.yaml`
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Docker Compose uses default passwords for Postgres and Redis in `docker-compose.platform.yml`

---

## 1. Authentication & Authorization (10 items)

### API Authentication
- [x] Verify ALL API endpoints require authentication tokens (except explicitly public endpoints like health checks) (public: `/health`, `/pricing/*`)
- [x] Audit authentication bypass vulnerabilities in FastAPI dependency injection
- [x] Verify Bearer token validation cannot be bypassed with malformed headers
- [x] Check for timing attacks in authentication verification (constant-time comparisons) (done for provisioner API key; review other paths)
- [ ] Ensure auth tokens have proper expiration and cannot be used indefinitely

### Admin Access Control
- [x] Verify no default admin accounts exist in the database seed data
- [x] Confirm admin privilege escalation is properly protected (users cannot make themselves admin)
- [x] Audit all admin-only endpoints for proper `verify_admin` dependency usage
- [x] Check that admin status changes are logged in audit logs
- [x] Verify admin actions cannot be performed through regular user endpoints

---

## 2. Multi-Tenancy & Data Isolation (8 items)

- [x] Check that network policies properly isolate instances
- [x] Ensure resource limits prevent denial of service
- [ ] Validate RBAC permissions follow least privilege principle
- [ ] Check that container images are from trusted sources
- [x] Verify secrets are mounted as volumes, not environment variables

### Network Security
- [ ] Ensure all traffic uses TLS/HTTPS encryption
- [x] Verify CORS policies prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests

---

## 7. Data Protection & Privacy (6 items)

### Sensitive Data Handling
- [ ] Verify PII is properly encrypted at rest
- [ ] Check that sensitive data is not logged
- [x] Ensure credit card data never touches your servers (Stripe handles it)
- [ ] Verify data deletion actually removes data (not just marks as deleted)
- [ ] Check compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR if applicable)
- [ ] Audit data retention policies and automatic cleanup

---

## 8. Dependency & Supply Chain Security (5 items)
