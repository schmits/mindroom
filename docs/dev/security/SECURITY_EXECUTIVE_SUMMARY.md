# MindRoom Security Review - Executive Summary

**Date:** September 15, 2025
**Updated:** March 18, 2026 (Repository audit)
**Status:** 🟠 MEDIUM-HIGH – Staging-only; production launch blocked by open security items

> **Audit note (2026-03-18):** Completion claims in this summary lack PR/commit proof.
> Alertmanager receiver configuration is still pending.
> Historical numeric risk scores are omitted because they lack a supporting methodology.
>
> **Evidence boundary:** This is a historical repository review, not a deployment attestation.
> “Present” below means visible in tracked code or configuration unless a dated live-environment result is cited.

## Overview

A comprehensive security review of the MindRoom SaaS platform was conducted across 12 security categories, covering authentication, multi-tenancy, secrets management, infrastructure, and application security. The most critical blockers (unauthenticated admin APIs, default credentials, missing rate limits) have been fixed, but several high/medium risks remain. Additional hardening is required before any production rollout.

## Key Security Improvements (September 17, 2025)

- ✅ Admin endpoint authentication, allowlists, and rate limiting are present in tracked code.
- ✅ `auth_monitor.py` provides IP-based lockout after 5 failures/15 minutes for the covered verification path.
- ✅ CSP, security headers, request-size limits, and trusted-host checks are present in tracked configuration.
- ✅ GDPR endpoints for export, deletion, and consent are present with automated tests.
- ✅ Per-instance network policies, RBAC restrictions, and read-only secret mounts are present in tracked charts.

## Outstanding High-Risk Work

1. **Secrets lifecycle:** run and document API key rotation; verify etcd-at-rest encryption for the production cluster.
2. **Monitoring & incident response:** configure alerting for auth/admin anomalies, build dashboards, publish IR playbook and `security@` contact/security.txt.
3. **Internal transport security:** decide on mTLS/service mesh (or document compensating controls) for intra-cluster traffic.
4. **Checklist backlog:** close remaining Medium items (input validation, dependency automation, frontend re-auth, API key rotation).

## Remaining Blockers Before Production

1. **Secrets lifecycle verification** – Execute/document rotation for DeepSeek/Google/OpenRouter keys; confirm etcd-at-rest encryption for managed clusters.
2. **Monitoring & IR readiness** – Add alerting for auth/admin anomalies, create incident runbooks, provision `security@` mailbox + security.txt.
3. **Internal service encryption** – Decide on mTLS/service mesh or document compensating controls; secure internal endpoints accordingly.
4. **Checklist gap closure** – Address outstanding items in input validation, token cache invalidation, dependency automation, and frontend hardening.

## Security Posture by Category (updated)

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Authentication & Authorization | ✅ PASS | Admin APIs locked down; auth monitoring + rate limits in place |
| Multi-Tenancy & Data Isolation | ✅ PASS | RLS, ownership validation, and webhook/payment isolation verified |
| Secrets Management | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Secrets via files, but rotation evidence + etcd encryption still pending |
| Input Validation & Injection | ⚠️ PARTIAL | CLI/script sanitization and comprehensive request validation outstanding |
| Session & Token Management | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Cache entries are bounded by JWT expiry, but server-side revocation or permission changes can remain stale for up to about five minutes; no revocation list |
| Infrastructure Security | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Instance pods hardened, platform pods still run as root; internal TLS undecided |
| Data Protection & Privacy | ⚠️ PARTIAL | GDPR workflows exist; confirm storage encryption & retention controls |
| Dependency & Supply Chain | ⚠️ PARTIAL | pnpm audit shows 5 vulns; automate scanning + upgrade path |
| Error Handling | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Base headers in place; need consistent sanitized error body strategy |
| API Security | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Webhook/user CAPTCHA absent; key rotation not yet executed |
| Monitoring & Incident Response | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Prometheus metrics and alert-rule manifests exist; configure and verify Alertmanager routing, dashboards, an owned IR playbook, and security.txt |
| Frontend Security | ⚠️ PARTIAL | CSP shipped; remove dev auth bypass & require re-auth for sensitive flows |

## Business Impact Assessment

### Risk Posture (September 17, 2025)
1. **Data Breach:** 🔶 Reduced; admin endpoints now locked down, but missing alert routing/IR playbook could delay detection.
2. **Financial Loss:** 🔶 Rotation tooling present, yet exposed keys still require confirmed rotation.
3. **Regulatory Exposure:** 🔶 GDPR workflows implemented; need retention & encryption verification before claiming compliance.
4. **Reputation Damage:** 🔶 Improved controls, but lack of disclosure process (no security@/security.txt) remains.
5. **Service Disruption:** 🟡 Rate limits and auth blocking help; internal TLS and incident response still outstanding.

### Compliance Status
- **GDPR:** ⚠️ PARTIAL – Export/delete/consent available; confirm data-at-rest encryption + retention policies.
- **SOC 2:** ⚠️ PARTIAL – Audit logs exist; need alerting, IR, and documented procedures.
- **PCI DSS:** N/A – Stripe processes payments (keep tokens client-side).
- **OWASP Top 10:** ⚠️ PARTIAL – Input validation, monitoring, and dependency automation still open.

## Implementation Highlights

- Phase 1 hardening (admin auth, rate limiting, logging) complete.
- GDPR endpoints, a log sanitizer, and CSP are present with automated tests, but global logging coverage is incomplete.
- Follow-up work includes secrets rotation verification, alert routing and incident response, and pod hardening; see the action plan for remaining tasks.

**Total Implementation Time:** ~3 engineering days to date (additional work pending)

## Implementation Results

- **Completed:** Admin/API hardening, auth monitoring, CSP, GDPR endpoints, per-instance isolation.
- **Remaining:** Secrets rotation validation, alerting/IR, pod hardening, dependency automation, frontend re-auth.
- **Risk Assessment:** Not quantified; further improvement is blocked by outstanding items.
- **Next Milestone:** Close High items and re-run the executive review.

## Recommendations (Pre-Launch)

1. Execute and document key rotation; confirm etcd encryption or enable it explicitly.
2. Wire Alertmanager receivers/dashboards and publish an incident response playbook + disclosure channels.
3. Harden platform deployments (non-root, read-only FS) and decide on internal TLS/mTLS.
4. Expand input validation and automate dependency/security scanning in CI.
5. Remove dev auth bypass, require re-auth for sensitive frontend actions, and audit third-party scripts.

## Conclusion

The platform is trending in the right direction—major blockers are resolved and multi-tenancy controls hold up under review. Nevertheless, the absence of secrets lifecycle verification, monitoring/IR, and pod hardening leaves meaningful exposure. Treat the environment as staging-only until the remaining work lands.

**Current Risk Level:** Not quantified; meaningful exposure remains.
**Production Ready:** ❌ No – high-priority tasks outstanding

### Production Deployment Decision

**Status: BLOCKED** 🚫

- **Security Posture:** Improved but missing verified rotation, alerting, and internal hardening.
- **Risk Level:** Meaningful and not quantified
- **Compliance:** GDPR workflows present; must confirm data-at-rest encryption + retention policies before attesting compliance.

**Recommendation:** Hold production deployment. Re-assess once secrets lifecycle, monitoring/IR, and infrastructure hardening tasks are complete and documented.
