# GitHub App Credentials for Git Knowledge Sources

## Goal

Allow a Git-backed knowledge source to authenticate as a GitHub App installation without storing a personal access token or a short-lived installation token in MindRoom's credential store.

## Credential contract

A named shared credential service may select GitHub App authentication with these fields:

```json
{
  "auth_type": "github_app",
  "app_id": 12345,
  "installation_id": 67890,
  "private_key_file": "/var/run/secrets/github-app/private-key.pem"
}
```

`app_id` and `installation_id` are non-secret deployment metadata.
`private_key_file` points to a read-only secret mount.
MindRoom never copies the private key or an installation access token into a credential file, Git configuration, checkout metadata, or logs.
Existing username/password/token credential services keep their current behavior.

## Token flow

Before an HTTPS clone, fetch, or Git LFS pull, MindRoom resolves the configured credential service.
For `auth_type: github_app`, it validates that the remote is an ordinary `https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>` URL, reads the private key, creates a short-lived app JWT, and requests an installation access token from GitHub.

The token request names exactly the repository from the remote and requests only `contents: read`.
The returned token is supplied to Git as process-local HTTP Basic authentication with username `x-access-token`.
The clean remote URL remains the only persisted URL.

The control-plane runtime caches each repository-scoped token until five minutes before GitHub's reported expiry.
Before starting a scheduled refresh child, the control plane resolves that cached token and sends the token plus its expiry only through the existing stdin request pipe.
The child primes its process-local provider before Git synchronization, so refresh subprocess isolation does not cause another token mint.
The handoff also identifies the App, installation, repository, and key path that authorized the token, and the child primes its provider only while its current credentials still match that identity.
If credentials rotate between the parent mint and child startup, the child ignores the handed-off token and mints one for the current credentials.
The parent-child handoff remains only in process memory and never uses a credential file, Git configuration, checkout metadata, refresh-child launch environment variable, or log.
When token refresh is required, MindRoom reads the private-key file again, so key rotation takes effect without rewriting runtime credential metadata.
Concurrent resolutions for one repository share one refresh operation.

## Failure behavior

Malformed GitHub App credentials fail closed with a field-specific configuration error.
GitHub App credentials reject non-GitHub hosts and remotes that do not identify exactly one owner and repository.
Missing or unreadable key files fail without including key contents.
GitHub token endpoint failures report HTTP status and installation ID, never response bodies or tokens.

If a cached token is still valid, a transient GitHub API failure does not occur because no refresh is attempted.
Once refresh is required, authentication fails rather than falling back to anonymous Git or stale static credentials.

## Structure

- `mindroom.knowledge.github_app_auth` owns credential parsing, repository extraction, JWT creation, token minting, expiry handling, process-lifetime caching, and child-cache priming.
- `mindroom.knowledge.git_source` selects static credentials or the GitHub App provider and injects the resulting secret into each Git subprocess.
- `mindroom.knowledge.refresh_runner` resolves cached tokens in the control plane and hands them to scheduled refresh children through the existing stdin request pipe.
- `KnowledgeGitConfig.credentials_service` remains the public configuration surface; no repository configuration schema change is required.

## Tests

Unit tests cover credential validation, GitHub URL validation, JWT/token request shape, least-privilege repository and permission scoping, cache reuse, expiry refresh, key rereading, concurrency, subprocess handoff, and redacted errors.
Git source tests prove clone/fetch/LFS request fresh credentials through the resolver while static credentials and secret non-persistence remain unchanged.

Deployment tests must prove credential seeds contain metadata only, the private key is mounted read-only only in the control plane, and rendered resources never place private-key material in environment variables or ConfigMaps.
