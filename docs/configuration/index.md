# Configuration

MindRoom is configured through a `config.yaml` file. This section covers all configuration options.

## Configuration File

MindRoom searches for the configuration file in this order (first match wins):

1. `MINDROOM_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable (if set)
2. `./config.yaml` (current working directory)
3. `~/.mindroom/config.yaml` (home directory)

Data storage (`mindroom_data/`) is placed next to the config file by default.

You can also validate a specific file directly:

```bash
mindroom config validate --path /path/to/config.yaml
```

## MCP Servers

MindRoom can connect to external Model Context Protocol servers through the top-level `mcp_servers` block.
See [MCP](../mcp.md) for transport-specific config, tool naming, examples, and agent setup.

## Tool Approval

Use the top-level `tool_approval` block to gate tool calls behind human approval in Matrix conversations.
Rules are evaluated in order and the first matching rule wins.
Each rule must set exactly one of `action` or `script`.
Use `action: require_approval` to always pause the tool call and send a Matrix approval card.
Use `script: ./approval_scripts/review.py` to run `check(tool_name, arguments, agent_name) -> bool` and require approval only when it returns `True`.
`timeout_days` sets the default approval expiry window and can be overridden per rule.
React to the approval card with `✅` to approve the tool call.
Reply to the approval card with a message to deny the tool call and record that text as the denial reason.
Only the original human requester can approve or deny their pending tool call.
Approval responses only resolve the live Matrix approval card in the same room; approval IDs are used only as a live client hint.
If MindRoom restarts before a tool call is approved, the live tool call is cancelled.
On startup, MindRoom attempts to mark recent unresolved approval cards sent by the current router as expired.
Agent-authored, system-authored, and configured bridge-bot-authored tool calls are denied instead of entering the approval flow.
OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` has no approval transport, so any tool function that matches a required-approval rule, including script-based rules, is hidden from the `/v1` tool schema instead of being exposed and blocked later.

```yaml
tool_approval:
  default: auto_approve
  timeout_days: 7
  rules:
    - match: slack_*
      action: require_approval
    - match: run_shell_command
      script: ./approval_scripts/shell_review.py
      timeout_days: 3
```

## Environment Variables

### Core

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MINDROOM_CONFIG_PATH` | Path to `config.yaml` | `./config.yaml` → `~/.mindroom/config.yaml` |
| `MINDROOM_STORAGE_PATH` | Data storage directory | `mindroom_data/` next to config |
| `MINDROOM_CONFIG_TEMPLATE` | Path to a config template. When set and `config.yaml` does not exist, MindRoom copies this template to the config path. Used in Docker containers to seed config from bundled templates | Same as config path |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level for `mindroom run` (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`) | `INFO` |
| `MINDROOM_LOGGER_LEVELS` | Optional comma- or semicolon-separated logger level overrides, for example `mindroom:DEBUG,httpx:WARNING,httpcore:WARNING,anthropic:INFO,nio:WARNING` | unset |

### Matrix

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MATRIX_HOMESERVER` | Matrix homeserver URL | `http://localhost:8008` |
| `MATRIX_SERVER_NAME` | Server name for federation | _(derived from homeserver)_ |
| `MATRIX_SSL_VERIFY` | Verify SSL certificates | `true` |

### API Keys

Set the API key for each provider you use in `config.yaml`:

| Variable | Provider |
|----------|----------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic (Claude) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Google (Gemini) |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenRouter |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | DeepSeek |
| `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` | Cerebras |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | Ollama (host URL, not a key) |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | Base URL for OpenAI-compatible APIs (e.g., local inference servers) |

All API key variables also support a `_FILE` suffix for file-based secrets (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/anthropic-api-key`).
See [Model Configuration — File-based Secrets](models.md#file-based-secrets) for details.

### Codex CLI Subscription Auth

The `codex` provider does not use an API key environment variable.
Run `codex login` so `~/.codex/auth.json` contains ChatGPT OAuth tokens.
Set `CODEX_HOME` only if your Codex CLI state lives outside `~/.codex`.

### Operational

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MINDROOM_NAMESPACE` | Installation namespace for Matrix identity isolation (4–32 lowercase alphanumeric chars) | _(none)_ |
| `MINDROOM_PORT` | Port used by Google OAuth callback URL construction and deployment tooling. Does **not** change the API server bind port — use `mindroom run --api-port` for that | `8765` |
| `MINDROOM_API_KEY` | API key for authenticating dashboard/API requests (`mindroom config init` auto-generates one; unset = open access) | _(none)_ |
| `MINDROOM_NO_AUTO_INSTALL_TOOLS` | Set to `1`/`true`/`yes` to disable automatic tool dependency installation | _(unset — auto-install enabled)_ |
| `MINDROOM_MATRIX_HOMESERVER_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Seconds to wait for homeserver to become reachable at startup (0 = skip). MindRoom polls the homeserver's `/_matrix/client/versions` endpoint with exponential backoff retry, detecting permanent errors (e.g., wrong URL) vs transient failures | _(wait indefinitely)_ |
| `MINDROOM_WORKER_BACKEND` | Worker backend for tool execution (`static_runner` or `kubernetes`) | `static_runner` |

### OpenAI-Compatible API

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OPENAI_COMPAT_API_KEYS` | Comma-separated API keys for authenticating `/v1/*` requests | _(none — locked without this or the flag below)_ |
| `OPENAI_COMPAT_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED` | Set to `true` to allow unauthenticated `/v1/*` access (local dev only) | _(unset — locked)_ |

See [OpenAI-Compatible API](../openai-api.md) for the full auth matrix.

### Provisioning / Pairing

These are set automatically by `mindroom connect` and stored in `.env`:

### Vertex AI

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID` | Google Cloud project ID for Vertex AI Claude |
| `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL` | Custom Vertex AI base URL |
| `CLOUD_ML_REGION` | Google Cloud region for Vertex AI |
| `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` | Google Cloud project ID |
| `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` | Google Cloud region |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | Path to Google service account JSON |

Authenticate with `gcloud auth application-default login` or set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.

### Worker / Sandbox

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MINDROOM_SANDBOX_PROXY_URL` | Sandbox proxy endpoint URL (static runner) | _(none)_ |
| `MINDROOM_SANDBOX_PROXY_TOKEN` | Auth token for the sandbox proxy | _(none)_ |

See [Sandbox Proxy](../deployment/sandbox-proxy.md) for the full list of `MINDROOM_SANDBOX_*` variables, including Kubernetes backend variables (`MINDROOM_SANDBOX_KUBERNETES_*`).

### SaaS-Only

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|

MindRoom uses `defaults.thread_summary_temperature` for automatic thread summaries on providers that support runtime temperature overrides.
Set it to `null` to omit the field and use provider defaults.
MindRoom always omits temperature for Vertex Claude thread summaries because the provider rejects that field on this path.

`defaults.worker_grantable_credentials` is a list of credential service names.
Use built-in names like `openai`, `anthropic`, `google`, `openrouter`, `deepseek`, `cerebras`, `groq`, `ollama`, and `github_private`, or custom shared credential service names you saved through the dashboard or API.
Google OAuth client config and Google OAuth token services stay in the primary runtime and cannot be mirrored into isolated workers.
If a tool runs inside an isolated worker, only the services listed here are available to that worker.
Leave this unset to keep isolated workers deny-by-default for shared credentials.
This setting never injects provider env vars such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

For worker-routed tools, it only controls which shared credentials MindRoom may load inside isolated workers.
This setting also does not control local shared-only integrations that stay in the main runtime, such as `homeassistant`.
Those tools keep using normal shared credentials even when `worker_grantable_credentials` is empty.
`google_vertex_adc` is intentionally not supported here because isolated workers do not receive ADC files or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`; use that auth path only in the main runtime.
Sandbox-proxied execution is stricter than direct local execution: ordinary runtime `.env` values and provider env do not carry over unless they are explicitly passed through.

# Required compaction is destructive inside the active session.
# It uses one Matrix lifecycle notice that is edited in place.
# It runs before a reply when raw history exceeds the hard replay budget.
# It also runs before the next reply after a manual compact_context request.
# Otherwise MindRoom leaves the stored session unchanged and relies on replay fitting for that reply.
# It rewrites the stored session summary and removes compacted raw runs from the live session.
# Agno then replays only the summary plus recent runs.
# Use __MINDROOM_INHERIT__ inside a tool override to clear one inherited authored field
# while keeping the rest of defaults.tools for that agent.
# See agents.md for the full per-agent tool configuration syntax.
# These thresholds only affect automatic thread summaries; manual `set_thread_summary`
# tool calls write immediately and reset the automatic baseline from the new message count.

matrix_delivery:
  ignore_unverified_devices: false # Default: false (keep Matrix E2EE device-trust checks enabled)

# Timezone for scheduled tasks (optional)
timezone: America/Los_Angeles      # Default: UTC
```

`matrix_delivery.ignore_unverified_devices` is an explicit opt-in for outgoing encrypted Matrix sends.
Leave it `false` to preserve Matrix E2EE device-trust checks.
Setting it to `true` can improve bot delivery when rooms contain unverified devices, but Matrix may encrypt messages for devices the bot has not verified.

## Credential Seeds

MindRoom can bootstrap additional shared credential services at startup from explicit seed declarations.
Use this for deployment-managed credentials that should live in `CredentialsManager` without requiring inline one-off migration scripts.
Seeded credentials are marked `_source=env`: MindRoom updates them on later startups, but it never overwrites dashboard-managed credentials (`_source=ui`) or legacy credentials with no source marker.

Set `MINDROOM_CREDENTIAL_SEEDS_FILE` to a JSON file path, or `MINDROOM_CREDENTIAL_SEEDS_JSON` to equivalent inline JSON.
Relative file paths resolve from the config directory.
Credential fields can read from env vars, from files, or from literal values:

```json
[
  {
    "service": "example_oauth_client",
    "credentials": {
      "client_id": {"env": "EXAMPLE_CLIENT_ID"},
      "client_secret": {"env": "EXAMPLE_CLIENT_SECRET"}
    }
  }
]
```

Env refs use the existing secret convention: if `EXAMPLE_CLIENT_SECRET` is unset, MindRoom also checks `EXAMPLE_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE` and reads that file.
If any declared field is missing or empty, MindRoom skips that seed instead of creating a partial credential document.

## Debug Logging

`debug.log_llm_requests` enables pre-provider request assembly logging for troubleshooting.
When enabled, MindRoom writes JSONL request records under `debug.llm_request_log_dir` or `mindroom_data/logs/llm_requests` by default.
Those records include prompts, messages, tool schemas, model parameters, correlation IDs, requester metadata, and source Matrix event metadata.
The same flag also records successful tool-call rows in `mindroom_data/tracking/tool_calls.jsonl` so tool activity can be correlated with LLM request logs.
Tool failures are always recorded in `tool_calls.jsonl`, even when request logging is disabled.
Audit logging remains enabled.
Credential-bearing fields such as tokens, cookies, passwords, API keys, and authorization headers are redacted before log records are emitted.
These artifacts can still contain sensitive non-credential prompt, argument, and result data.
Leave the flag disabled unless you are actively debugging.

## Managed Avatars

MindRoom can generate managed avatars for agents, teams, rooms, and the optional root Matrix Space.
Use the optional `avatars.prompts` block to override the built-in prompt styles without editing Python code.
Every field is optional and falls back to MindRoom's built-in defaults when omitted.

```yaml
avatars:
  prompts:
    character_style: "professional AI avatar portrait, abstract geometric silhouette"
    room_style: "minimalist wayfinding icon, precise geometry, strong silhouette"
    agent_system_prompt: "You are creating distinctive visual elements for a professional AI agent avatar."
    team_system_prompt: "You are creating distinctive visual elements for a professional AI team avatar."
    room_system_prompt: "You are creating a refined, minimalist icon design for a room avatar."
```

`mindroom avatars generate` only creates missing local avatar files by default.
Run `mindroom avatars generate --force` to overwrite existing managed workspace avatar files after changing prompts or styles.
`mindroom avatars sync` only fills missing Matrix avatars by default.
Run `mindroom avatars sync --force` to replace existing Matrix room or root-space avatars.

## Internal User Username

- Configure `mindroom_user.username` with the Matrix localpart you want before first startup.
- After the account is created, `mindroom_user.username` is locked and cannot be changed in-place.
- You can safely change `mindroom_user.display_name` at any time.

## Notes

- All top-level sections are optional with sensible defaults, but at least one agent is recommended for Matrix interactions
- A model named `default` is required unless agents, teams, and the router all specify explicit non-`default` models
- Agents can set `knowledge_bases`, but each entry must exist in the top-level `knowledge_bases` section
- `agents.<name>.accept_invites` defaults to `true`; when enabled, authorized ad-hoc room invites are accepted and persisted across restarts without adding those rooms to the static `rooms` list
- Approval-gated tools require the router to be joined to the Matrix room.
- In ad-hoc invited rooms accepted through `accept_invites`, approval only works if the router is already joined to that room.
- `agents.<name>.context_files` load files from the agent's workspace into each agent instance, so edits take effect on the next reply without restarting (see [Agents](agents.md))
- `agents.<name>.room_thread_modes` overrides `thread_mode` for specific rooms, and resolution is room-aware for agents, teams, and router decisions (see [Agents](agents.md))
- `memory.backend` sets the global memory default, and `agents.<name>.memory_backend` overrides it per agent
- `memory.backend: none`, `memory: none`, or `agents.<name>.memory_backend: none` disables built-in durable memory for the effective agent without disabling Agno Learning
- `defaults.max_preload_chars` caps preloaded file context (`context_files`)
- When `authorization.default_room_access` is `false`, only users in `global_users` or room-specific `room_permissions` can interact with agents
- `authorization.agent_reply_permissions` can further restrict which users specific agents/teams/router will reply to
- `authorization.aliases` maps bridge bot user IDs to canonical users so bridged messages inherit the same permissions (see [Authorization](../authorization.md))
- `authorization.room_permissions` accepts room IDs, full room aliases, and managed room keys
- `matrix_room_access.mode` defaults to `single_user_private`; this preserves current private/invite-only behavior
- In `multi_user` mode, MindRoom sets managed room join rules and directory visibility from config
- In `multi_user` mode, MindRoom also reconciles managed room power levels so `com.mindroom.thread.tags` can be written at PL0
- Publishing to the room directory requires the managing service account (typically router) to have moderator/admin power in each room
- Thread-tag power-level reconciliation also requires the managing service account to be joined and able to update `m.room.power_levels`
- The `memory` system works out of the box with OpenAI; use `memory.llm` for memory summarization with a different provider
