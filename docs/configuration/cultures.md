# Culture Configuration

Cultures let a group of agents share evolving principles, practices, and conventions. A culture is backed by [Agno's CultureManager](https://docs.agno.com/agents/culture) and persists its knowledge in a SQLite database under `mindroom_data/culture/<culture_name>.db`.

## Basic Culture

```yaml
cultures:
  engineering:
    description: Follow clean code principles and write tests
    agents: [developer, reviewer]
```

## Full Configuration

```yaml
cultures:
  engineering:
    # Describes the shared principles this culture captures
    description: Follow clean code principles, write tests, and review before merging

    # Agents assigned to this culture (must be defined in agents section)
    agents:
      - developer
      - reviewer

    # How the culture is updated: automatic, agentic, or manual (default: automatic)
    mode: automatic
```

## Configuration Fields

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `description` | No | `""` | Description of the shared principles and practices the culture captures |
| `agents` | No | `[]` | Agent names assigned to this culture (must exist in the `agents` section). Each agent can belong to at most one culture |
| `mode` | No | `"automatic"` | How culture knowledge is updated (see modes below) |

## Culture Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `automatic` | Culture knowledge is automatically extracted from every agent interaction and added to the shared context |
| `agentic` | The agent decides when to update culture knowledge via a tool call |
| `manual` | Culture context is read-only; the description is included in agent context but knowledge is never updated |

All modes include the culture description in the agent's context. The difference is whether and how the culture's knowledge base evolves over time.

## Rules

- Each agent can belong to **at most one** culture. Assigning the same agent to multiple cultures is a validation error.
- All agents listed in a culture must exist in the top-level `agents` section.
- Culture state is persisted to `mindroom_data/culture/<culture_name>.db` and survives restarts.
- Culture managers are cached and shared across agents in the same culture — if two agents belong to the same culture, they share the same `CultureManager` instance.
- For private agents, culture storage and manager caches are scoped to the resolved requester identity, so different requesters do not share culture state.
- Changes to a culture's `description` or `mode` in `config.yaml` invalidate the cache, so the manager is recreated on the next hot-reload.
