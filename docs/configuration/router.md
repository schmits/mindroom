# Router Configuration

The router is a built-in system component that handles intelligent message routing and room management. It decides which agent should respond when no specific agent is mentioned, sends welcome messages to new rooms, and manages various system-level tasks.

## Configuration

```yaml
router:
  # Model for routing decisions (defaults to "default")
  model: haiku

  # Accept authorized room invites and preserve them across restarts (default: true)
  accept_invites: true

  # Participate in room-level startup prewarm for rooms already joined at first sync (default: true)
  startup_thread_prewarm: true
```

The router has three configuration options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | string | `"default"` | Model to use for routing decisions |
| `accept_invites` | bool | `true` | When enabled, the router accepts authorized room invites, persists accepted room IDs, rejoins them after restart, and preserves them during room cleanup |
| `startup_thread_prewarm` | bool | `true` | When enabled, the router may prewarm recent thread snapshots for rooms already joined when first sync completes, which can reduce cold-cache latency for early thread replies after startup |

Startup thread prewarm is a background, best-effort cache warmup for rooms already joined when first sync completes.

## How Routing Works

When a message arrives in a room without a specific agent mention:

1. The router checks if there are configured agents in that room
2. It analyzes the message content and any recent thread context (up to 3 previous messages)
3. Based on the available agents' roles, tools, and instructions, it selects the best match
4. The router posts a message mentioning the selected agent (e.g., "@agent could you help with this?")
5. The mentioned agent sees the mention and responds in the thread

The router uses a structured output schema to ensure consistent routing decisions, including the agent name and reasoning for the selection.

## Router Responsibilities

The router is a special system agent that handles several important tasks beyond message routing:

### Command Handling

The router exclusively handles all commands:

- `!help [topic]` - Get help on commands or specific topics
- `!hi` - Show the welcome message again
- `!schedule <task>` - Schedule tasks and reminders
- `!list_schedules` - List scheduled tasks
- `!cancel_schedule <id>` - Cancel a scheduled task
- `!edit_schedule <id> <task>` - Edit an existing scheduled task
- `!config <operation>` - Manage configuration

Even in single-agent rooms, commands are always processed by the router.

### Welcome Messages

When the router joins a room with no messages (or only a previous welcome message), it automatically sends a welcome message listing:

- All available agents in that room with their descriptions
- How to interact with agents (mentions, commands)
- Quick command reference

Use `!hi` in any room to see the welcome message again.

### Room Management

The router creates and manages rooms:

- Creates configured rooms that don't exist yet
- Invites agents and users to their configured rooms
- Applies `matrix_room_access` policy for managed rooms (when enabled)
- Reconciles managed room power levels so the custom thread-tags state event can be written at PL0
- Generates AI-powered room topics based on configured agents
- Has admin privileges to manage room membership
- Cleans up orphaned bots on startup

By default (`matrix_room_access.mode: single_user_private`), rooms remain invite-only and private in the room directory.
In `multi_user` mode, the router can set join rules (`public`/`knock`) and optionally publish rooms to the server directory.
That same reconciliation path also updates `m.room.power_levels` for managed rooms, so the router must be joined and able to edit room power levels when thread tags are enabled.

### Voice Message Processing

Audio events are handled through the shared media pipeline on all bots.
The router only posts a visible handoff when it must disambiguate between multiple eligible responders in a multi-agent room.
When the responder is already clear, normalized audio follows the normal direct agent or team dispatch rules without an extra router message.
Set `voice.visible_router_echo: true` if you also want the router to post the normalized voice text as a display-only message when it is allowed to reply.
See [Voice Messages](../voice.md) for the detailed dispatch behavior.

### Configuration Confirmations

The router handles interactive configuration changes. When a config change is requested, the router posts a confirmation message with reactions, and only the router processes the confirmation reactions.

### Scheduled Task Restoration

When the router joins a room, it restores any previously scheduled tasks and pending configuration changes to ensure they persist across restarts.

## Routing Behavior Details

### Single-Agent Optimization

When there's only one agent configured in a room, the router skips AI routing entirely. The single agent handles messages directly, which is faster and more efficient.

### Multi-Human Thread Protection

When multiple human users have posted in a thread, the router and agents require an explicit `@mention` before responding. This prevents agents from injecting themselves into human-to-human conversations.

The rules are:

1. **Mentioned agents always respond** — an explicit `@agent` overrides all other rules.
2. **Non-thread messages** — agents auto-respond if they're the only agent in the room, regardless of how many humans are present.
3. **Threads with one human** — normal auto-response behavior applies (the agent continues the conversation).
4. **Threads with two or more humans** — agents stay silent unless explicitly mentioned.
5. **Mentioning a non-agent user** — if a message tags only humans (not agents), agents stay silent.

#### Bot accounts

By default, any Matrix user that is not a MindRoom agent counts as a "human" for the rules above. This includes bridge bots (Telegram, Slack, etc.) and other non-MindRoom bots. If a bridge bot relays a message into a thread, it looks like a second human to MindRoom and triggers the mention requirement.

To prevent this, list those accounts in `bot_accounts`:

```yaml
bot_accounts:
  - "@telegram:example.com"
  - "@slackbot:example.com"
```

Accounts in this list are treated like MindRoom agents for response logic — their messages and mentions don't count toward the multi-human detection.

### Routing Fallback

If routing fails (model error, invalid suggestion, etc.), the router sends a helpful error message: "⚠️ I couldn't determine which agent should help with this. Please try mentioning an agent directly with @ or rephrase your request."

Users can always mention agents directly with `@agent_name` to bypass routing.

## Note on the Router Agent

The router is always present and cannot be disabled. It automatically joins any room with configured agents. If no `router` section is configured, it uses the default model.

The router account is not a conversational AI agent to tag directly.
If a message mentions only the router and no other users or agents, the router replies with the rules of engagement instead of answering the prompt.
Mention a specific agent when you want that agent to answer, or mention multiple agents when you want them to collaborate.
When one human and one agent are already talking in a thread, continuing without an explicit tag is fine.
Once a thread has multiple human users or multiple agent participants, tag the agent or agents you want next.
In a new untagged message, automatic routing can still choose an agent when that is appropriate.
