"""Backend-neutral contract for the event journal, projection, and outbox.

Every test here runs on SQLite and on PostgreSQL. A rule that holds on only one
backend is a rule MindRoom does not actually have.

The exceptions are the two contention tests, which ask what two connections do
to the same row. SQLite has no second connection *in this process* to ask that
of -- the backend is one process behind one writer -- so running them there
would prove only that the fixture took turns. Both take the PostgreSQL-only
``rival_stores`` fixture, which is where that is spelled out.

SQLite does get a second connection, and not from a fixture: ``mindroom threads
export`` is another process with another writer on the same file. That is the
one thing here no object can stage, so ``TestCrossProcessWriters`` spawns a real
interpreter to be it.

        """One event ID reaches the projection at most once, whatever it carries.

        This is why the projection needs no tiebreak for two payloads claiming
        one event ID, and the visible-message scan does. That scan merges a
        replacement bundled under `unsigned` with the standalone copy of the
        same event from the same page, so it genuinely holds two payloads for
        one ID and has to order them by content rather than by arrival.

        Nothing writing here can produce that pair. Admission conflicts on the
        `(principal_id, event_id)` primary key and returns before `project()`
        is called at all, so the losing payload is not ranked against the
        stored revision -- it never reaches the comparison. Unifying the two
        rules would move a JSON dump of every replacement onto this path, which
        streaming walks tens to hundreds of times per response, to decide a
        case it cannot observe.

        The second payload is given a later timestamp deliberately. A real
        second copy of one event carries the server's own `origin_server_ts`
        and would tie, and a tie is refused by the ordering rule as well as by
        the key -- so a tied payload would prove only that one of the two
        defences held. A payload that would win on the ordering rule isolates
        the key as the thing that stops it.

        fence has already committed, so the epoch it reads is the new one and
        any implementation declines. This half is what happens when the fence
        has not committed yet.

        Two writers on one database is the deployed shape, not a contrivance:
        `mindroom threads export` opens the running install's journal in its own

        lock that serializes writes inside one process orders nothing between
        them. Under ``READ COMMITTED`` the walk's plain epoch ``SELECT`` saw the
        membership it expected, the fence then deleted every row committed at
        that instant, and the walk's rows landed behind it -- a conversation
        from a membership the bot has left, projected under an epoch no reader
        of `visible_messages` filters on, and served into every prompt from then
        on. Nothing takes them back out: the walk that runs under the new
        membership projects over them with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so the two
        memberships end up merged into one conversation.

        Modelled with two stores over one database rather than two operating
        system processes: what makes the race possible is two writer connections
        with no lock between them, which is exactly what two stores are. The
        window is opened by pausing the walk after its first statement -- the
        real transaction, the real SQL, only held open -- and the fence is a

        so; what it proves is that being told costs it the terminal record too.
        It cannot prove this half, because by the time it runs there is no race
        left to lose -- the losing implementation below passes it untouched.

        This half is what happens when nobody has been told anything yet. Two
        connections against one PostgreSQL database can both observe an unbound
        row, and an implementation that reads the column and then updates it
        hands each of them a win: the outbox keeps whichever event landed last,
