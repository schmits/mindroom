"""Pending-turn-claim invariants for the inbound turn pipeline.

A live inbound turn claims its source events in the ``TurnStore``
(``TurnStore.try_claim_turn``) *before* any text or media normalization runs,
and every acquired claim is released exactly once on every path that does not
transfer the claim into the coalescing gate (ignored, consumed, failed, or
cancelled ingress). When the gate admits the event, the pre-gate claim travels
as ``PendingDispatchMetadata`` and is closed at batch flush, before dispatch
re-claims the same sources for response execution.

These are characterization tests for the turn-pipeline lifecycle refactor:
they pin the current leak-free behavior through the focused ``TurnController``
harness (real ``TurnStore``, ``CoalescingGate``, and ingress lanes).
