"""A journal write issued from a second event loop has to come back.

Agno runs a synchronous tool as ``await asyncio.to_thread(function_call.execute)``,
so its hook chain lands on a worker thread with no loop of its own, and
``_run_coroutine_from_sync`` (``tool_system/tool_hooks.py``) gives it one with
``asyncio.run``. Any journal write that chain triggers is therefore issued
from a loop that is not the one the store's writer task lives on. The runtime
loop is still running, so the write itself is fine -- the writer commits it --
but the caller has to be woken on its own loop, and a loop whose only pending
work is that write has no reason to wake unless something tells it to.

When it is not told, the caller never resumes: the row is committed and
visible to every reader, while the coroutine that wrote it waits forever,
holding whatever it was in the middle of publishing.
