"""Execution-side, under-lock assembly of one response request's payload.

Ingress (``TurnController`` + ``text_ingress_dispatch``) builds a complete,
immutable :class:`ResponsePayloadPreparation` value and hands it to the
response runner inside the :class:`~mindroom.response_runner.ResponseRequest`.
Once the runner owns the lifecycle lock and has refreshed thread history, it
calls :meth:`ResponsePayloadPreparer.prepare` to finish assembling the request.

Data crosses the seam as values, and the work runs here as a first-class named
step rather than as a closure back into ingress.
