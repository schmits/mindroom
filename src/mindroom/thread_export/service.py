    Rooms come from ``matrix_state.yaml`` plus every entity's persisted invited rooms when at least
    one target includes invited rooms.
    Invited rooms are exported with the invited entity's own account, because the primary export
    account is not necessarily a member of user-created rooms.

    With ``prefer_cache`` thread bodies are served from the validated durable event cache and only
    fetched from the homeserver on miss or invalidation; a failing miss-refetch may then fall back to
    stale cached rows instead of failing the thread.
    Only use it while the runtime keeps the cache fresh (in-process or alongside a live ``mindroom run``).

    Each source thread is fetched once per room and fanned out to every authorized target.
    Scoped targets export only rooms where their required member is currently joined.
    A failed membership check leaves prior exports untouched, records a failure, and writes nothing new.
    A successful check that proves the member absent removes the prior room export.
