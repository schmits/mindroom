"""Turns committed journal events into semantic work.

The journal decides what MindRoom owes. This decides when it runs. Nothing
here is durable: a crash leaves every unsettled event exactly as pending as it
was, which is why there is no ``running`` state to get stuck in.

Every bound here is paired with a signal that more work remains. A pass that
stops early — because a room is busy, because the scan hit its page budget, or
because a lane failed — arranges to be woken again. A bound that silently drops
the remainder is how durable work ends up abandoned while the process looks
healthy.
