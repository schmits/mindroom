"""Shared Matrix thread-read diagnostic keys.

A leaf module so the reader that produces ``ThreadHistoryResult`` diagnostics and
``thread_membership``, which consumes them for root proofs, need not import each other.

``thread_read_source`` has one value left: ``degraded``, the empty fail-open result of a read
that could not complete. It is separate from ``thread_read_degraded`` because a caller can flag
a read degraded while still returning its content, and only the source says the content is
absent -- which is the distinction the two predicates below turn on.
