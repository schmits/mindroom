    Sync ingestion admits only joined-room ``timeline.events`` and deliberately

    and receipts, presence, account data, to-device events, and device-list
    changes.

    Point lookup is broader than visible conversation history, so any admitted
    timeline event with an event ID can be retained while thread projection
    renders only supported ``m.room.message`` content.

    Redaction envelopes are not stored as point events, while their durable
    effect removes or tombstones the target and repairs dependent indexes.

    Membership loss is a separate lifecycle concern and does not currently
    purge retained joined-room history.
