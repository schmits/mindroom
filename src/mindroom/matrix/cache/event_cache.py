    Every returned row belongs to ``principal_id`` and ``room_id``.
    A runtime-wide storage service must expose one bound view per authenticated Matrix
    account instead of sharing this interface directly between bots.

    Sync ingestion admits only joined-room ``timeline.events`` and deliberately
    excludes complete room state, invite and leave timelines, ephemeral typing
    and receipts, presence, account data, to-device events, and device-list
    changes.

    Point lookup is broader than visible conversation history, so any admitted
    timeline event with an event ID can be retained while thread projection
    renders only supported ``m.room.message`` content.

    Redaction envelopes are not stored as point events, while their durable
    effect removes or tombstones the target and repairs dependent indexes.

    Membership loss fences access and purges only the departed principal's
    retained joined-room history.
