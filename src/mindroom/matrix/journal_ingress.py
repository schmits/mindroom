    A notice is the exception at any provenance. `m.notice` means "automated,

    -- so admitting one as work would have agents answering each other's thread
    summaries, their own streaming placeholders, and every bridge relay. They

    stream frames: those are notices, so they are covered by being notices.

    `RoomMessageUnknown` carries no `body`, so there is no utterance for a turn
