"""Prompt-cache breakpoint ladder for Anthropic-family Claude models.

Anthropic prompt caching only reuses the request prefix (tools -> system ->
messages) up to explicit ``cache_control`` breakpoints, and cache lookups only
probe roughly the last twenty content blocks before each breakpoint. Agno's
``cache_system_prompt`` marks the system block alone, so nothing after the
system prompt is ever cached: every tool-loop iteration re-processes all
earlier iterations of the same run, and once a turn grows past the lookup
window the next turn cannot reach the previous boundary at all.

This hook wraps the Anthropic SDK client used by Agno's Claude models and adds
up to three more breakpoints to each outgoing request:

- the newest cacheable content block (text / tool_result / document / image),
  so each request extends the cache entry written by the previous one;
- the newest cacheable block of an earlier message, as a fallback boundary for
  requests whose trailing messages were rewritten;
- the last tool definition, so the tools array survives system-prompt changes.

All markers share one TTL derived from the model settings, so the request
never mixes TTLs out of order (the API requires longer TTLs first, which is
also why Agno's ``cache_tools`` flag must stay off: it always emits a 5m tools
marker ahead of a potentially 1h system marker). The total marker count,
including markers Agno itself adds, is capped at the API limit of four.

The ladder operates on the wire-format request (after Agno's
``format_messages``) because Agno rebuilds assistant and tool_result blocks
from scratch on every request, so markers placed on Agno ``Message`` objects
can never reach tool results. String-vs-block content shape is irrelevant at
this layer: ``format_messages`` normalizes user strings into text blocks, and
the API hashes both shapes identically.

The same wire hook also carries Anthropic's server-side tool search for
MindRoom's deferred tools: :func:`install_claude_deferred_tool_search` records
the wire tool names that should stay out of the rendered prompt prefix, and
``_prepared`` tags them with ``defer_loading: true``, injects the regex search
tool, and orders the tools array deterministically (non-deferred first, then
deferred sorted by name). Deferred tools may not carry ``cache_control`` (the
API rejects the request), which is why the ladder's tools marker targets the
last non-deferred tool.

The hook's third job is history repair: replayed tool-search results are
stripped down to the request schema, references to tools absent from the
current request are removed, and search uses missing their result are removed.
These response shapes otherwise produce a 400 on the next request. This is why
the client proxy is installed unconditionally — the ladder and defer tagging
gate themselves per request, but a cache-disabled model with no deferred tools
can still replay poisoned history.
