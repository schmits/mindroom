"""Deterministic, claim-before-send delivery.

Two crashes have to be survivable at once: a crash after Matrix accepted a
message but before MindRoom recorded it, and a crash after a model produced
content but before it was sent. The first is handled by the deterministic
transaction ID, which makes a resend a no-op on the homeserver. The second is
handled by claiming: the row's payload becomes immutable at the moment it is
first attempted.

That first guarantee has a boundary, and the row records where it ends. A
Matrix transaction ID is idempotent within the device that used it, so a row
attempted before a re-login carries an ID the homeserver has never seen from
the device now retrying, and the "no-op" resend posts a second answer. The
claim therefore stores the sending device alongside the attempt, which is what
lets delivery notice that the guarantee no longer holds and go and look
instead.

Claiming is what closes the dangerous case. Without it, a restarted turn could
regenerate different content, send it under the transaction ID the homeserver
already accepted, and have it silently discarded — leaving the durable result
and the visible message permanently disagreeing.
