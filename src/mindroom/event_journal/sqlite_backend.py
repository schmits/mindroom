"""SQLite backend: one writer task per process behind a queue, readers in WAL.

Concurrent writers are what produce ``database is locked`` under load, so
within a process there is exactly one. Every write is submitted to a queue
drained by a single task, which means that serialization is a property of the
structure rather than of a timeout being long enough.

Per process, and the qualifier is the whole of it. ``mindroom threads export``
opens this same file from its own process and hydrates through it, so a
deployment running the documented ``--watch`` pass alongside a bot has two
writers on one database and no shared queue to put them in. What serializes
*those* is the busy timeout, and nothing else -- exactly the arrangement the
queue exists to avoid, arrived at from outside where the queue cannot reach.

Which is survivable, and is not free. A write blocks the other process's next
write for as long as it runs, and an export installing one hydrated
conversation runs for as long as that conversation is large: a few hundred
messages is milliseconds, and the ceilings in ``thread_export`` permit far
more than the ten seconds another process is willing to wait. Past that the
loser is refused rather than delayed. On the bot that refusal reaches
``journal_ingress``, which declines the event instead of accepting one it did
not commit -- the checkpoint holds, nio redelivers, and no event is lost. The
cost is a stalled sync round trip, not a hole in the journal.
