"""Durable admission and replay of inbound Matrix events.

Admission is the boundary that makes the no-loss guarantee real: nio is told an
event was accepted only after this transaction commits, so a crash before the
commit leaves the event for redelivery rather than losing it.

There is deliberately no durable ``running`` state. A process that dies
mid-turn must leave its event eligible for retry, and a state that says
"someone is working on this" would instead leave it stranded until a human
noticed.
