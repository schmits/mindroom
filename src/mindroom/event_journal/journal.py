"""Durable admission and replay of inbound Matrix events.

Admission is the boundary that makes the no-loss guarantee real: nio is told an
event was accepted only after this transaction commits, so a crash before the
commit leaves the event for redelivery rather than losing it.

There is deliberately no durable ``running`` state. A process that dies
mid-turn must leave its event eligible for retry, and a state that says
"someone is working on this" would instead leave it stranded until a human
noticed.

    One departure reaches the bot twice: locally, the moment it leaves, and
    again in the sync response reporting the leave. Deciding which of the two
    is a repeat is the whole job, and it happens inside the same transaction as
    the invalidation so that a crash between deciding and invalidating is not a
    state this can be left in. Recording "a report is still owed" for an
    advance that never committed would cost the departure its only fence.

    The two observers are not symmetric, so their bookkeeping is not either:

    - A local departure is always followed by a sync report of it, so it leaves
      a debt behind for that report to consume. A rejoin does not clear the
      debt: the report is still owed, and when it comes it still describes the
      departure that was already fenced.
    - A sync report has no local counterpart to wait for -- most departures the
      bot did not initiate never produce one -- so it leaves no debt. It marks
      the room fenced instead, which is what suppresses the local observation
      of the same departure when the sync response gets there first.

    That asymmetry is in what each observation *records*, not in whether it may
    fence a room that is already fenced. Neither may. Matrix can replay an old
    leave after the room has rejoined, and one ended membership can appear as
    consecutive leave/ban observations. Each report's stable observation id is
    therefore mapped durably to its contiguous departure run in this same
    transaction. The run spends one owed local report; its aliases spend none.
    The Matrix event id supplies identity when visible, otherwise the sync
    response token does. A replay then remains a replay even after a join has
    closed the run and re-armed the room for a genuinely new departure.

    Restricting it to ``TURN_BACKED_KINDS`` is the same argument one step
    further: pending means unfinished, not *will answer*. Thread membership is
    derived from content for every kind alike -- ``inbound_event`` calls
    ``thread_root`` regardless of kind -- so a reaction, an approval, or an
    ``m.room.encrypted`` event this bot could not decrypt can all sit pending
    in a thread under the requester's own sender. An interactive reaction can
    produce a response, but only as a continuation of its selected question;
    it is not a newer conversation turn that supersedes older ingress.
    Counting one as such can drop the older message without replacing it.
    Only a message or a media event can become the turn that legitimately
    supersedes another.
