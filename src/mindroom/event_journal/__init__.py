"""Durable ownership of inbound Matrix events, visible content, and delivery.

Three facts live here, each with exactly one owner:

- what MindRoom accepted from Matrix and still owes work for (the journal),
- what a conversation currently looks like (the projection),
- what MindRoom intends to send and whether it landed (the outbox).
