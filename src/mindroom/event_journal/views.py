"""The narrow slices of a principal's store that collaborators actually use.

`PrincipalStore` is one object with twenty-eight methods covering admission,
replay, membership, conversation reads, hydration, refetch, and delivery. That
is the shape of the universal cache dependency this design exists to remove:
once every collaborator holds the whole surface, any of them can reach for any
part of it, and the boundaries stop being real.

These protocols are what each collaborator is actually allowed to do. They are
structural, so `PrincipalStore` satisfies them without declaring anything, and
they cost nothing at runtime -- the enforcement is the type checker refusing a
call the annotation does not permit. The point is not to hide the store; it is
that a hydrator reaching into the outbox should fail review by failing to
type-check.
