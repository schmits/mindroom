        True in the ordinary case, and the reason recovery can resend without
        thinking: the homeserver remembers the transaction ID and returns the
        event the first attempt produced.

        It stops being true when the sending device changes, because a Matrix
        transaction ID is scoped to the device that used it. A row attempted by
        a device this process is no longer logged in as carries an ID the
        homeserver has never seen from *this* device, so the resend is accepted
        as a new message and the room gets the answer twice.

        What separates the safe rows from the rest is whether anyone has
        *attempted* this one, not whether a device is recorded. An unattempted
        row has no device for the uninteresting reason that nothing has sent
        it, and there is no earlier event for a resend to collide with, so it
        is exempt and no first delivery pays for this guard.

        Once a row is attempted, an unrecorded device is not "unchanged" -- it
        is a device nobody can name, which is the case the resend cannot be
        proven safe in. That covers a row written before the column existed,
        and a process that cannot name the device it is about to send from.
        An earlier version of this returned True for both, reasoning that
        reconciling would put a backward scan in front of every ordinary
        recovery. That reasoning was wrong twice over: ordinary recovery
        records its device before sending, so those rows compare equal and
        scan nothing, and the rows that do reach here are the rare ones --
        attempted, unacknowledged, and older than the column or sent by a
        process mid-login. Reconciling them costs one scan and cannot lose an
        ordinary answer because ordinary workers resend after a miss. Workers
        for actionable events instead retain the debt when a miss cannot prove
        the earlier event absent.

        Edits follow the same rule. A delayed duplicate edit can arrive after
        a newer replacement and overwrite it, so recovery must adopt the first
        physical edit instead of sending another.
