"""Turning admitted journal events into the typed Matrix callbacks MindRoom has.

The journal owns what was accepted and what still owes work. This owns the
fan-out: which callback runs for an event, whether the callback finished the
work or handed it to a turn, and who is allowed to consume a reaction that
several features could each claim.

The important asymmetry is between callbacks that finish and callbacks that
defer. Most reactions finish in their handler; an interactive reaction and a
message hand work to a response task that may still run long after the callback
returns. So a deferring handler leaves its event pending, and the source is
settled when its answer is durably owed to a room -- the FINAL outbox enqueue
-- or when the turn deliberately owes no answer at all. That is why a crash
mid-turn replays the message rather than losing the answer, and why a crash
after the answer is durable does not spend the model again.
