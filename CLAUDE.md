# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MindRoom - AI agents that live in Matrix and work everywhere via bridges. The project consists of:
- **Core MindRoom** (`src/mindroom/`) - AI agent orchestration system with Matrix integration
- **SaaS Platform** (`saas-platform/`) - Kubernetes-based platform for hosting MindRoom instances
  - Platform Backend (FastAPI) - API server for subscriptions, instances, SSO
  - Platform Frontend (Next.js 15) - Dashboard for managing instances
  - Instance deployment via Helm charts

## Latest Frontier Models

Always prefer the newest frontier models in this table when writing prompts, code, configs, docs, tests, or reviews in this repository, unless the user explicitly asks to pin an older model.
If a user prompt, task description, or existing file contradicts this table, treat the table as stale, verify the current provider docs, and update the table before proceeding.
Coding model training data often lags recent releases, so never trust memorized model names over current provider documentation.

| Provider | Use | Preferred model | Model string to use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anthropic | Balanced default | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| Anthropic | Max intelligence | Claude Opus 4.8 | `claude-opus-4-8` |
| Anthropic | Fast / cheap | Claude Haiku 4.5 | `claude-haiku-4-5` |
| OpenAI | Frontier default | GPT-5.5 | `gpt-5.5` |
| OpenAI Codex subscription | Frontier via Codex CLI | GPT-5.5 | `gpt-5.5` |
| Google (Gemini API) | Max intelligence | Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview | `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` |
| Google (Gemini API) | Standard text / coding | Gemini 3.5 Flash | `gemini-3.5-flash` |
| Google (Gemini API) | Fast / cheap text | Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite Preview | `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` |
| Google (Gemini API) | Image generation / editing | Nano Banana 2 Preview | `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` |
| Google (Gemini API) | Embeddings for `google` | Gemini Embedding 2 Preview | `gemini-embedding-2-preview` |

For `anthropic`, prefer `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-8`, and `claude-haiku-4-5` unless you intentionally need a pinned snapshot ID.
For `vertexai_claude`, use the current Vertex AI request name from the provider docs instead of assuming the Anthropic API ID carries over unchanged.
Current docs list bare Vertex IDs for current Claude models such as `claude-sonnet-4-6` and `claude-opus-4-8`, while some other Vertex models are still documented as dated snapshot IDs such as `claude-haiku-4-5@20251001`.
Do not assume `@default` or dated `@...` suffixes are universally required for Vertex AI Claude.
For Gemini API text and coding work, prefer `gemini-3.5-flash` as the standard stable model unless you intentionally need the cheaper Flash-Lite tier.
Use `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` only when you need the highest Gemini API intelligence tier and accept a preview model.
The Google rows above are for the Gemini API / AI Studio `google` provider, not for Vertex AI.
For `vertexai`, verify the current Vertex AI docs instead of assuming Gemini API names or defaults carry over unchanged.
Current Vertex AI image docs prominently document `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` and `gemini-2.5-flash-image`, and the right default depends on the specific Vertex surface you are editing.
For Google image work, use the official product name from the docs for the provider surface you are editing.
Gemini API docs call `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` Nano Banana 2, while Vertex AI docs use their own product naming and model tables.

## Architecture

### Core MindRoom (`src/mindroom/`)

**MultiAgentOrchestrator** (`orchestrator.py`) is the heart of the system - it boots every configured entity (router, agents, teams), provisions Matrix users, and keeps sync loops alive with hot-reload support when `config.yaml` changes.

**Entity types**:
- `router`: Built-in traffic director that greets rooms and decides which agent or team should answer
- **Agents**: Single-specialty actors defined under `agents:` in `config.yaml`
- **Teams**: Collaborative bundles of agents that coordinate or parallelize work

**Inbound turn pipeline** (the path from a Matrix message to a delivered response; see `docs/architecture/bot-runtime.md`):

```text
Matrix sync callback
  -> bot.py (AgentBot/TeamBot runtime shell)
  -> turn_controller.py (owns one turn: precheck -> normalize -> resolve -> coalesce -> decide -> execute -> record)
       -> inbound_turn_normalizer.py + conversation_resolver.py  (canonical turn input, conversation identity)
       -> coalescing.py                                          (debounced batching per room/thread)
       -> text_ingress_dispatch.py + turn_policy.py              (commands; ignore / route / respond decision)
       -> response_runner.py -> ai.py                            (lifecycle lock, Agno agent/team run)
       -> streaming.py + delivery_gateway.py                     (progressive edits, Matrix send)
       -> turn_store.py / handled_turns.py                       (durable dedup so restarts don't double-reply)
```

### Ecosystem Repositories

MindRoom also maintains related repositories under `github.com/mindroom-ai`:
- `mindroom-element` - our Element fork for MindRoom message UX: collapsible tool-trace rendering, `!` command autocomplete synced from backend commands, long-text sidecar hydration, AI run metadata tooltip, and MindRoom branding/thread-first defaults. See `README.md` and `FORK_CHANGES.md` in that repo.
- `synapse` - our Synapse fork for MindRoom streaming workloads: optional compact-edit collapsing for superseded `m.replace` events across `/sync`, Sliding Sync, pagination, and context responses, plus `/versions` advertisement via `org.mindroom.compact_edits` and fork-owned Docker/CI flows. See `README.md` and `FORK_CHANGES.md`.
- `mindroom-librechat` - our LibreChat fork that parses MindRoom inline `<tool>` / `<tool-group>` tags into native `ToolCall` cards so tool execution stays server-side; also includes fork Docker CI and MindRoom-specific UX additions. See `README.md` and `.mindroom/` docs (`fork-context.md`, `tool-tag-rendering.md`).
- `mindroom-cinny` - our Cinny fork optimized for MindRoom agent workflows with MindRoom branding/default homeserver config, subpath deployment support (runtime/build base path for `/mindroom`), and thread/auth/sidebar UX refinements. See `README.md` and `FORK_CHANGES.md`.
- `mindroom-stack` - a full Docker Compose reference stack that boots the published MindRoom backend/frontend, a Tuwunel Matrix homeserver, and the MindRoom client together, including first-login and model/API-key setup guidance.

In this dev environment, many of these repositories are cloned in the parent directory (`../`) and can be inspected directly.

### Configuration Model

The authoritative config is `config.yaml`, loaded via Pydantic models in `src/mindroom/config/` (root model in `src/mindroom/config/main.py`):

```yaml
agents:
  code:
    display_name: CodeAgent
    role: Generate code, manage files, execute shell commands
    model: sonnet
    tools: [file, shell]
    instructions:
      - Always read files before modifying them.
    rooms: [lobby, dev]
    knowledge_bases: [engineering_docs]

timezone: America/Los_Angeles
```

**Hot reloading**: `config.yaml` changes are watched at runtime. The orchestrator diffs configs, gracefully restarts affected agents, and rejoins rooms without bringing down the stack.

### Memory System

Mem0 memory (`src/mindroom/memory/functions.py`):
- **Agent memory** (`agent_<name>`) – Personal preferences, coding style, tasks
- **Team memory** – Shared context for team collaboration

### Teams & Collaboration

Teams (`src/mindroom/teams.py`) let multiple agents work together:
- **coordinate**: Lead agent orchestrates others
- **collaborate**: All members respond in parallel with consensus summary

## 1. Core Philosophy

- **Embrace Change, Avoid Backward Compatibility**: This project has no end-users yet. Prioritize innovation and improvement over maintaining backward compatibility.
- **Simplicity is Key**: Implement the simplest possible solution. Avoid over-engineering or generalizing features prematurely.
- **Focus on the Task**: Implement only the requested feature, without adding extras.
- **Functional Over Classes**: Prefer a functional programming style for Python over complex class hierarchies.
- **Keep it DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself. Reuse code wherever possible.
- **Be Ruthless with Code Removal**: Aggressively remove any unused code, including functions, imports, and variables.
- **Prefer dataclasses**: Use `dataclasses` that can be typed over dictionaries for better type safety and clarity.
- **Documentation Line Style**: In Markdown docs, write one sentence per line, and never split a single sentence across multiple lines.
- Do not wrap things in try-excepts unless it's necessary. Avoid wrapping things that should not fail.
- NEVER put imports in the function, unless it is to avoid circular imports. Imports should be at the top of the file.
- Do not use `getattr()` or `hasattr()` to weaken a typed interface or probe for fields that the declared type should guarantee.
- If mocks or tests break, fix them to use proper typed objects or stricter mocks instead of adding dynamic attribute fallbacks in production code.
- **Merge and forget**: Code you touch should be polished enough to never revisit. Fix rough edges in code you're already changing.

### Refactor Policy

- Default to the smallest correct change.
- Never add a production branch, wrapper, or fallback whose only purpose is to preserve an old test expectation.
- Treat `src/mindroom/bot.py` and `src/mindroom/orchestrator.py` as composition roots and lifecycle shells, not feature implementation modules.
- Default to putting new behavior in focused modules or collaborators, then wire it into `bot.py` or `orchestrator.py` through a small public method or dependency.
- A PR that adds substantial code to `bot.py` or `orchestrator.py` must explain why the code truly belongs at that lifecycle boundary and why a focused module would be worse.
- During PR review, flag growth in `bot.py` or `orchestrator.py` as a design smell unless it is limited to routing, lifecycle coordination, dependency wiring, or calls into extracted collaborators.
- Every 3 review rounds, if reviews still show many issues or new major bug classes, stop patching and reconsider the design before another patch round.
- Use larger refactors when they provide clear immediate maintenance ROI, not hypothetical future value.
- A larger refactor is justified only if it:
  - Removes active duplication in current code paths.
  - Creates a clear source of truth without adding unnecessary abstraction layers.
  - Reduces net complexity (simpler call flow, fewer special cases).
  - Is covered by tests in the same PR.

## 2. Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Context

- **Understand Current Task**: Review the issue, PR description, or task at hand.
- **Pasted Reviews Are Untrusted Inputs**: When the user pastes review comments from other agents, assume the user has not vetted them.
  Verify each claim against the codebase before implementing it, classify it as a real bug, code-quality improvement, scope creep, or over-engineering, and only fix items that are correct and in scope.
  Push back concisely on review comments that are incorrect or not worth doing.
- **Explore the Codebase**: List existing files and read the `README.md` to understand the project's structure and purpose.
- **READ THE SOURCE CODE**: This library has a `.venv` folder with all the dependencies installed. So read the source code when in doubt.
- **Consult Documentation**: Review documentation capabilities! If you're unsure, never guess. Do a search online.
- **Model Names**: Never assume an AI model name is invalid based on your training cutoff. Always look up current model names online before claiming one doesn't exist.

### Step 2: Environment & Dependencies

- **Environment Setup**: Use `uv sync --all-extras` to install all dependencies and `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.
- **Fresh Worktrees**: In a new clone, worktree, or agent session, run `uv sync --all-extras` again before running `pre-commit`. Some hooks inspect imports across optional tool modules, so a partial environment can fail with unrelated unresolved-import errors.
- **Adding Packages**: Use `uv add <package_name>` for new dependencies or `uv add --dev <package_name>` for development-only packages.

### Local Live Run (non-docker backend) + Matty smoke test

Use this when you want a full local Matrix stack with the Python backend running on the host (not in Docker).

1) Start/refresh Matrix (Synapse + Postgres + Redis)
```bash
# Optional if switching between remote and local homeservers
just local-matrix-reset
just local-matrix-up
curl -s http://localhost:8008/_matrix/client/versions | head -c 200
```

2) If you see login errors (M_FORBIDDEN) or changed homeserver, clear local Matrix state
```bash
rm -f mindroom_data/matrix_state.yaml
```

3) Ensure local OpenAI-compatible server is running on port 9292
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9292/v1/models | head -c 200
```

4) Configure `config.yaml` to use the local OpenAI-compatible server
- Set relevant models to `provider: openai`
- Use a model ID that exists on the local server (e.g., `gpt-oss-low:20b`)
- Add `extra_kwargs.base_url: http://localhost:9292/v1` for those models
- For memory, prefer `provider: openai` and an embedding model that exists (e.g., `embeddinggemma:300m`)

5) Run the backend with explicit env overrides (use Python 3.13; production Dockerfile also uses 3.13)
```bash
MATRIX_HOMESERVER=http://localhost:8008 \
MATRIX_SSL_VERIFY=false \
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9292/v1 \
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-test \
UV_PYTHON=3.13 \
uv run mindroom run
```

6) Wait for API health, then for rooms to appear (room creation uses AI topics)
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8765/api/health
MATRIX_HOMESERVER=http://localhost:8008 MATRIX_SSL_VERIFY=false \
uv run --python 3.13 matty rooms
```

7) Matty smoke test (agent reply in a thread)
```bash
MATRIX_HOMESERVER=http://localhost:8008 MATRIX_SSL_VERIFY=false \
uv run --python 3.13 matty send "Lobby" "Hello @general please reply with pong."

MATRIX_HOMESERVER=http://localhost:8008 MATRIX_SSL_VERIFY=false \
uv run --python 3.13 matty threads "Lobby"

MATRIX_HOMESERVER=http://localhost:8008 MATRIX_SSL_VERIFY=false \
uv run --python 3.13 matty thread "Lobby" t1
```

### Hosted Matrix Run (`uvx`) + Pairing

Use this when Matrix + chat UI are hosted and only the MindRoom backend runs locally.

1) Initialize local config with hosted defaults
```bash
uvx mindroom config init --profile public
```

2) Add at least one model provider key in `~/.mindroom/.env` (for example `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`)

3) Generate a pair code in `https://chat.mindroom.chat` (`Settings -> Local MindRoom`) and pair locally
```bash
uvx mindroom connect --pair-code ABCD-EFGH
```

4) Start MindRoom
```bash
uvx mindroom run
```

`mindroom connect` writes `MINDROOM_LOCAL_CLIENT_ID` and `MINDROOM_LOCAL_CLIENT_SECRET` to `~/.mindroom/.env` by default (unless `--no-persist-env` is used) and auto-replaces owner placeholder tokens in `config.yaml` when `owner_user_id` is returned.

### SaaS Platform Commands

#### Development
```bash
# Platform Backend
cd saas-platform/platform-backend
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Platform Frontend
cd saas-platform/platform-frontend
bun install && bun run dev
```

#### Deployment
```bash
# Set kubeconfig path
export KUBECONFIG=./cluster/terraform/terraform-k8s/mindroom-k8s_kubeconfig.yaml

# Deploy platform
helm upgrade --install platform ./cluster/k8s/platform -f cluster/k8s/platform/values.yaml --namespace mindroom-staging

# Deploy instance - ALWAYS use the provisioner API:
./cluster/scripts/mindroom-cli.sh provision 1

# The provisioner handles everything:
# - Creates database records
# - Manages secrets securely
# - Deploys via Helm with proper values
# - Tracks status

# Manual Helm deployment (debugging only, not for production):
# helm upgrade --install instance-1 ./cluster/k8s/instance \
#   --namespace mindroom-instances \
#   -f values-with-secrets.yaml  # Never commit this file!

# Quick redeploy of MindRoom backend (updates all instances)
./saas-platform/redeploy-mindroom.sh

# Deploy platform frontend or backend
./saas-platform/deploy.sh platform-frontend  # Build, push, and deploy frontend
./saas-platform/deploy.sh platform-backend   # Build, push, and deploy backend

# Use the CLI helper for common operations
./cluster/scripts/mindroom-cli.sh status
./cluster/scripts/mindroom-cli.sh list
./cluster/scripts/mindroom-cli.sh logs 1
```

### Step 3: Development & Git

- **Check for Changes**: Before starting, review the latest changes from the main branch with `git diff origin/main | cat`. Make sure to use `--no-pager`, or pipe the output to `cat`.
- **Commit Frequently**: Make small, frequent commits.
- **Atomic Commits**: Ensure each commit corresponds to a tested, working state.
- **Targeted Adds**: **NEVER** use `git add .`. Always add files individually (`git add <filename>`) to prevent committing unrelated changes.

### Step 4: Testing & Quality

- **Test Before Committing**: **NEVER** claim a task is complete without running `pytest` to ensure all tests pass.
- **Run Pre-commit Hooks**: After `uv sync --all-extras`, run `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` before committing to enforce code style and quality.
- **Update Tach Boundaries in the Same PR**: If your PR changes a Tach-governed boundary, update `tach.toml` in the same PR, follow the guidance in the comment at the top of that file, and run `uv run tach check --dependencies --interfaces`.
- **Handle Linter Issues**:
  - **False Positives**: The linter may incorrectly flag issues in `pyproject.toml`; these can be ignored.
  - **Test-Related Errors**: If a pre-commit fix breaks a test (e.g., by removing an unused but necessary fixture), suppress the warning with a `# noqa: <error_code>` comment.

### Step 5: Refactoring

- **Be Proactive**: Continuously look for opportunities to refactor and improve the codebase for better organization and readability.
- **Incremental Changes**: Refactor in small, testable steps. Run tests after each change and commit on success.

### Step 6: Viewing the Widget

- **Taking Screenshots**: To view the dashboard without Jupyter, use `python frontend/take_screenshot.py` from the project root.
- **Manual Screenshot**: From the frontend directory, run `bun run dev` to start the development server, then run `bun run screenshot` in another terminal.
- **Screenshot Location**: Screenshots are saved to `frontend/screenshots/` with timestamps.
- **Use Cases**: This is helpful for visual verification, documentation, and sharing the dashboard appearance.

### Developer Automation (`justfile`)

Common `just` recipes for development:
```bash
# Local stacks
just local-matrix-up              # Boot Synapse + Postgres dev stack
just local-platform-compose-up    # Full SaaS sandbox

# Testing (IMPORTANT: enter `nix-shell shell.nix` first on NixOS hosts)
# If `uv run pytest` fails with 'module mindroom has no attribute bot',
# use the repo dev shell so `libstdc++.so.6` is available:
nix-shell shell.nix
# Then run commands normally inside the shell, for example:
uv run pytest tests/<file>.py -x -n 0 --no-cov -v
# If `<nixpkgs>` is unresolved, use:
nix-shell -I nixpkgs=/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels/nixos shell.nix
# Or if the above works, you can also use:
just test-backend                 # Run pytest for core (may need nix-shell wrapper)
just test-saas-backend            # Run pytest for SaaS backend

# Deployment
just cluster-helm-template        # Render platform chart manifests
just cluster-helm-lint            # Lint platform chart
```

## 3. Critical "Don'ts"

- **DO NOT** manually edit the CLI help messages in `README.md`. They are auto-generated.
- **NEVER** use `git add .`.
- **NEVER** claim a task is done without passing all `pytest` tests.

## 4. Interacting with MindRoom Agents via Matty CLI

### Overview
Matty is a Matrix CLI client that allows you to interact with MindRoom AI agents. Use it to send messages and observe agent responses during development and testing.

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Matty is installed as a project dependency
# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
# Now you can use matty directly
```

### Configuration
The Matrix credentials are already configured in the project's `.env` file. Matty will automatically use these credentials.

### Essential Commands for Agent Interaction

#### 1. List Rooms
```bash
matty rooms  # or: matty r
```

#### 2. View Messages (See Agent Responses)
```bash
matty messages "room_name" --limit 20  # or: matty m "room_name" -l 20
```

#### 3. Send Messages to Agents
```bash
# Direct message
matty send "room_name" "Hello @assistant!"

# Multiple agent mentions
matty send "room_name" "@research @analyst analyze this topic"
```

#### 4. Work with Threads (Agents respond in threads)
```bash
# List threads in a room
matty threads "room_name"

# View thread messages (where agents typically respond)
matty thread "room_name" t1  # View thread with ID t1

# Start a thread (agents will respond here)
matty thread-start "room_name" m2 "Starting discussion with agents"

# Reply in thread
matty thread-reply "room_name" t1 "@assistant continue"
```

### Typical Agent Testing Workflow
```bash
# 1. Find the test room
matty rooms

# 2. Send a message mentioning agents
matty send "test_room" "@assistant What can you do?"

# 3. Check for agent response (agents respond in threads)
matty threads "test_room"
matty thread "test_room" t1  # View the thread where agent responded

# 4. Continue conversation in thread
matty thread-reply "test_room" t1 "@research find information about X"
```

### Important Notes
- **Agents respond in threads**: Always check threads after sending messages
- **Use @mentions**: Tag agents with @ to get their attention
- **Message handles**: Use m1, m2, m3 to reference messages
- **Thread IDs**: Use t1, t2, t3 to reference threads (persistent across sessions)
- **Output formats**: Add `--format json` for machine-readable output
- **Streaming responses**: If you see "⋯" in agent messages, they're still typing. Agents stream responses by editing messages, which may take 10+ seconds to complete. Re-check the thread after waiting.

## 5. Quick Reference

```bash
# Preflight check before running
mindroom doctor

# Run the stack
uv run mindroom run --storage-path mindroom_data

# Pair local install with hosted provisioning
mindroom connect --pair-code ABCD-EFGH

# Bootstrap local Synapse + MindRoom Cinny (Docker)
mindroom local-stack-setup --synapse-dir /path/to/mindroom-stack/local/matrix

# Update credentials
# Edit .env for provider/bootstrap keys and restart; configure tool credentials through the dashboard or persisted tool config

# Discover commands
# Send !help from any bridged room

# Debug logging
mindroom run --log-level DEBUG  # Surface routing decisions, tool calls, config reloads
```

Inspect agent traces: `mindroom_data/sessions/<agent>.db`

## 6. Releases

Use `gh release create` to create releases. The tag is created automatically.

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Ensure you're on latest origin/main before releasing!
git fetch origin
git checkout origin/main

# Check current version
git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -1

# Create release (minor version bump: v0.2.2 -> v0.3.0)
gh release create v0.3.0 --title "v0.3.0" --notes "release notes here"
```

Versioning:
- **Patch** (v0.2.2 -> v0.2.3): Bug fixes
- **Minor** (v0.2.3 -> v0.3.0): New features, non-breaking changes

Write release notes manually describing what changed. Group by features and bug fixes.

# Important Instruction Reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
